# PFND3DDDI_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL callback function


## -description


The <b>CreateAuthenticatedChannel</b> function creates a channel that the Microsoft Direct3D runtime and the driver can use to set and query protections. 


## -parameters




### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param *

*pData* [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542918">D3DDDIARG_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL</a> structure. On input, this structure contains information that the driver can use. On output, the driver specifies information in the structure that the Direct3D runtime can use. 


## -returns



<b>CreateAuthenticatedChannel</b> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The channel is successfully created.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0a565bff-fc6f-41c1-a6fd-3a82dd0d7889">CreateAuthenticatedChannel</a> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_NOTAVAILABLE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The driver does not support the channel type that is specified in the <b>ChannelType</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542918">D3DDDIARG_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter points to. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The runtime passes the handle to the authenticated channel that the driver returns in the <b>ChannelType</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542918">D3DDDIARG_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL</a> structure in all subsequent calls that require the handle. 

The driver must keep track of the display device (<i>hDevice</i>) that was used to create the authenticated channel. The driver should fail all subsequent calls that use this created authenticated channel (for example, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/627f9689-1059-4f88-9005-9c7600dad686">AuthenticatedChannelKeyExchange</a> function) if the display device that is specified in those calls is different from the display device that was used to create the authenticated channel.
