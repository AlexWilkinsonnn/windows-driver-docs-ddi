# IFileCallbackClose interface


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The framework can notify a driver when the driver should perform a close operation.  The driver can handle the notification by registering the <b>IFileCallbackClose</b> interface.

A driver registers the <b>IFileCallbackClose</b> interface when it calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to create a device object.
