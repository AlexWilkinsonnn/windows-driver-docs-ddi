# IoStartPacket function


## -description


The <b>IoStartPacket</b> routine calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563858">StartIo</a> routine with the given IRP or inserts the IRP into the device queue associated with the given device object if the device is already busy. 


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the target device object for the IRP.


### -param Irp [in]

Pointer to the IRP to be processed.


### -param Key [in, optional]

Pointer to a value that determines where to insert the packet into the device queue. If this is zero, the packet is inserted at the tail of the device queue.


### -param CancelFunction [in, optional]

Specifies the entry point for a driver-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406716">Cancel</a> routine.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



If the driver is already busy processing a request for the target device object, then the packet is queued in the device queue. Otherwise, this routine calls the driver's <i>StartIo</i> routine with the specified IRP.

If a non-NULL <i>CancelFunction</i> pointer is supplied, it is set in the IRP so the driver's <i>Cancel</i> routine is called if the IRP is canceled before its completion.

Drivers that do not have a <i>StartIo</i> routine cannot call <b>IoStartPacket</b>.

Callers of <b>IoStartPacket</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. Usually, this routine is called from a device driver's Dispatch routine at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.
