# IAllocatorMXF interface


## -description


The <code>IAllocatorMXF</code> interface manages buffer storage for DirectMusic streams. The DMus port driver implements this interface and exposes it to the DMus miniport driver. The DMus port driver creates an <code>IAllocatorMXF</code> object and passes a pointer to this object to the DMus miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536701">IMiniportDMus::NewStream</a> method. <code>IAllocatorMXF</code> inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536782">IMXF</a> interface.

<code>IAllocatorMXF</code> is the interface through which the miniport driver communicates with the port driver's internal <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8f263288-2f79-4f1d-b740-d78d40f47b32">allocator</a>, which allocates and manages the reuse of a pool of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536340">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a> structures. Each structure can contain a time-stamped MIDI event.

The allocator also abstracts the allocation of the additional memory that is needed to store large events. The <b>uData</b> member of DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT is a union that is the size of a pointer: four bytes on a 32-bit system and eight bytes on a 64-bit system. If the data is small enough to fit in that space, then <b>uData</b> will contain the actual MIDI data. If the data for that event is larger than the 4- or 8-byte pointer, however, the <b>cbEvent</b> member indicates this fact and <b>uData</b> contains a pointer to a buffer instead of the actual MIDI data. This buffer is managed by the allocator and is a constant size for any port-driver implementation.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IAllocatorMXF</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAllocatorMXF</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IAllocatorMXF</b> interface has these methods.

</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
The <code>GetMessage</code> method serves as the retrieval point for any DirectMusic kernel-mode component that utilizes the port driver's allocator to reuse <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536340">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a> structures.

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536495">IAllocatorMXF::PutBuffer</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">

   This method is not currently used by the miniport driver. The <code>PutBuffer</code> method passes a buffer to the allocator, but this occurs automatically when <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536791">IMXF::PutMessage</a> is called anyway.
