# _VIDEO_MEMORY_INFORMATION structure


## -description


The VIDEO_MEMORY_INFORMATION structure contains information about a mapping of video memory into system space or the private virtual address space of a user-mode process. The mapping is created when an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567812">IOCTL_VIDEO_MAP_VIDEO_MEMORY</a> request is sent to the video miniport driver.


## -struct-fields




### -field VideoRamBase

Virtual address of the video RAM in system space or in the address space of the user-mode process that initiated the request.


### -field VideoRamLength

The size, in bytes, of the virtual address range that is mapped to video RAM. Memory accessible through a bank switch mechanism is not described by this value.

This value must be equal to the product <b>VideoMemoryBitmapHeight</b> * <b>ScreenStride</b>, where each factor in the product is a member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570521">VIDEO_MODE_INFORMATION</a> structure.


### -field FrameBufferBase

Pointer to the virtual address of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f697e0db-1db0-4a81-94d8-0ca079885480">frame buffer</a> in the caller's address space. The frame buffer is the actively displayed part of video RAM.


### -field FrameBufferLength

Specifies the linear length of the frame buffer in the caller's virtual address space. Memory accessible through a bank switch mechanism is not described by this value.

This value must be equal to the product <b>VisScreenWidth</b> * <b>ScreenStride</b>, where each term in this product is a member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570521">VIDEO_MODE_INFORMATION</a> structure.


## -remarks



In the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567812">IOCTL_VIDEO_MAP_VIDEO_MEMORY</a> request, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570506">VIDEO_MEMORY</a> serves as an input structure, while VIDEO_MEMORY_INFORMATION serves as an output structure.
