# PAGP_COMMIT_VIRTUAL callback function


## -description


The <b>AgpCommitVirtual</b> function maps reserved virtual memory to an associated range of AGP-decodable physical addresses.


## -parameters




### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the device extension of the miniport driver'.


### -param VirtualReserveContext [in]

Identifies a reserved virtual address range. The context handle was obtained from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/966dfc6c-6830-4872-b411-2801e3a4b753">AgpReserveVirtual</a>.


### -param Pages [in]

Specifies the number of pages of virtual memory to map.


### -param Offset [in]

Specifies the page offset at which to commit the pages. The offset is applied to the reserved virtual address range that is identified by <b>VirtualReserveContext</b>.


## -returns



<b>AgpCommitVirtual</b> returns the virtual address for the base of the committed pages if the mapping succeeded; otherwise returns <b>NULL</b>.




## -remarks



Before calling <b>AgpCommitVirtual</b> to commit a range of virtual pages, you must do the following:

<ul>
<li>
Call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b3e21c94-acd5-4767-8ba5-70b2dcfb2aaa">AgpReservePhysical</a> to reserve a range of physical addresses for the GPU to use.

</li>
<li>
Call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3c3a6936-7435-4a42-99e6-2c048613af23">AgpCommitPhysical</a> to map a portion (or all) of the reserved physical addresses to locked pages in system memory.

</li>
<li>
Call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/966dfc6c-6830-4872-b411-2801e3a4b753">AgpReserveVirtual</a> to reserve a range of virtual addresses that is associated with the range of physical addresses reserved by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b3e21c94-acd5-4767-8ba5-70b2dcfb2aaa">AgpReservePhysical</a>.

</li>
</ul>
After these items are completed, you can call <b>AgpCommitVirtual</b> to map a portion of the reserved virtual pages to pages that have already been mapped and locked by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3c3a6936-7435-4a42-99e6-2c048613af23">AgpCommitPhysical</a>. You must not attempt to map a page of virtual addresses if the corresponding page of physical addresses has not already been mapped.

Video miniport drivers that run on Microsoft Windows 2000 should always commit a virtual range whose size is a multiple of 64 kilobytes. If you call <b>AgpCommitVirtual</b> to commit a virtual range that is not a multiple of 64 kilobytes, it can return an invalid virtual address.

On Windows XP and later, <b>AgpCommitVirtual</b> automatically expands the committed range so that it is a multiple of 64 kilobytes.

When a miniport driver calls <b>AgpCommitVirtual</b>, a portion of the virtual address range identified by <b>VirtualReserveContext</b> is mapped to physical addresses. The mapped portion begins <i>Offset</i> pages into the virtual address range that is identified by <b>VirtualReserveContext</b>.
