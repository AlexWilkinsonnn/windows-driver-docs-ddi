## -description


The routine 
      is a system-supplied routine that retrieves  and the following:

<i>KStrClockGetCorrelatedTime</i> is a system-supplied routine that retrieves both the current system time and the corresponding clock tick count since boot.

<i>KStrClockGetCorrelatedPhysicalTime</i> is a system-supplied routine that retrieves both the current system time minus suspended delta and the corresponding clock tick since boot.


## -parameters




### -param FileObject [in]

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545834">FILE_OBJECT</a> structure to which a handle was returned when the clock instance was created.


### -param SystemTime [out]

A pointer to a 64-bit integer containing the number of clock ticks since system boot.


## -returns



This routine returns the current system time as a value of type LONGLONG. This value is specified in 100 nanosecond units.




## -remarks



You can obtain an entry point for this routine by supplying a driver-allocated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561020">KSCLOCK_FUNCTIONTABLE</a> structure in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564466">KSPROPERTY_CLOCK_FUNCTIONTABLE</a> request.

The system time is acquired from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553053">KeQueryPerformanceCounter</a>.

Both time values are specified in 100 nanosecond units.
