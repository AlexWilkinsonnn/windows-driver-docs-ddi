# KsSetTargetState function


## -description


Sets the enabled state of a target device associated with the specified object header.


## -parameters




### -param Header [in]

Points to a header previously allocated by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560958">KsAllocateDeviceHeader</a>.


### -param TargetState [in]

Contains the new state of the target associated with this object header. This may be either KSTARGET_STATE_DISABLED or KSTARGET_STATE_ENABLED.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



Assumes that such a target has been set with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566845">KsSetTargetDeviceObject</a>. The target is initially disabled, and is ignored when recalculating stack depth. For WDM Streaming devices, this is called on a transition back to a Stop state, after having enabled the target and used <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0b8f23a5-af8a-4b99-8f17-092076523914">KsRecalculateStackDepth</a> on a transition to Acquire state. This allows the stack depth to be minimized.
