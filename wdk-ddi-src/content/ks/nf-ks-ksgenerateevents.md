# KsGenerateEvents function


## -description


The<b> KsGenerateEvents</b> function generates events of an indicated type that are present in <i>Object</i>'s event list.


## -parameters




### -param Object [in]

The object on which to generate events. This can be an AVStream filter or pin object.


### -param EventSet [in, optional]

The event set GUID to match to determine which events to generate. If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, set GUID is not taken into account for determining matching events.


### -param EventId [in]

The event ID to match to determine which events to generate.


### -param DataSize [in]

The size in bytes of the data with which to generate the data event.


### -param Data [in, optional]

A pointer to a data buffer to include in the event notification. If the driver does not need to convey additional information via the notification, set this optional parameter to <b>NULL</b>.


### -param CallBack [in, optional]

A pointer to a caller-specified function that is called to determine whether a given event should be generated. If this is <b>NULL</b>, no callback verification is performed to determine whether an event should be generated (only <i>EventSet </i>and <i>EventId</i> are used).


### -param CallBackContext [in, optional]

A pointer to a caller-specified context that is passed to the callback function <i>CallBack</i>.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



When calling this function, a minidriver must place <i>Data</i> and <i>CallBackContext</i> in a locked, nonpageable data segment. In addition, note that the <i>CallBack</i> is made at DISPATCH_LEVEL. The callback function must be in a locked segment and must be prepared to run at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. Note that there is an additional issue in DX8 <i>only</i>: <i>EventSet</i> must be in a locked data segment.

Minidrivers typically do not call this function directly and instead use one of the versions that performs appropriate casting: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562541">KsFilterGenerateEvents</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563500">KsPinGenerateEvents</a>.

An event is generated if it is present in <i>Object's </i>event list and <i>EventId </i>matches the event's ID, <i>EventSet</i> either matches the event's set GUID or is <b>NULL</b>, and <i>CallBack </i>is either <b>NULL</b> or authorizes the match.

<i>CallBack</i> is a caller-specified callback used for additional match determination. It is prototyped as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>BOOLEAN CallBack (IN PVOID Context, IN PKSEVENT_ENTRY EventEntry);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
AVStream passes the contents of the <b>KsGenerateEvents</b> routine's parameter <i>CallBackContext</i> in this callback's <i>Context</i> parameter. <i>EventEntry</i> is a pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561853">KSEVENT_ENTRY</a> structure that specifies the event that would be generated. The callback function should return <b>TRUE</b> if this event should be generated.
