# KsSetMajorFunctionHandler function


## -description


The <b>KsSetMajorFunctionHandler</b> function sets the handler for a specified major function to use the internal dispatching. It routes through a KSDISPATCH_TABLE contained in the opaque object header to be the first element within a structure pointed to by an <b>FsContext</b> within a file object. The dispatching assumes the table and <b>FsContext</b> structure are initialized by the device using <b>KsAllocateObjectHeader</b>.


## -parameters




### -param DriverObject [in]

Specifies the driver object whose major function is to be handled.


### -param MajorFunction [in]

Specifies the major function identifier to be handled. This sets the major function pointer in the driver object to an internal function that then dispatches to the <b>KSDISPATCH_TABLE</b> function. The pointer to this table is assumed to be the first element in a structure pointed to by <b>FsContext</b> in the file object of the specific IRP being dispatched. The valid major function identifiers are as listed.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Identifier</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_CREATE 

</td>
<td>
Create IRP. In this instance, a create request could be used for either creating a new instance of a filter, or for creating some object such as a pin under a filter or a clock under a pin. This assumes that the first element in the driver object's extent contains a KSDEVICE_HEADER structure that is used to find the type of object to create, based on the name passed. If a parent file object is specified, then that object's KSDISPATCH_TABLE.ChildCreateHandlerTable in the <b>FsContext</b> is looked at to determine what handler to use for the create, or use the device object's table.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_CLOSE 

</td>
<td>
 Close IRP.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL 

</td>
<td>
 Device control IRP.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_READ 

</td>
<td>
 Read IRP.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_WRITE 

</td>
<td>
 Write IRP.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS 

</td>

 Flush IRP.

</td>

<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_QUERY_SECURITY 

</td>

 Query security information.

</td>

<tr>
<td>
IRP_MJ_SET_SECURITY 

</td>
<td>
 Set security information.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSDISPATCH_FASTIO 

</td>
<td>
This flag may be added to the MajorFunction identifier in order to specify that the entry refers to the fast I/O dispatch table, rather than the typical major function entry. This is valid only with IRP_MJ_READ, IRP_MJ_WRITE or IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL. The driver is responsible for creating the DriverObject->FastIoDispatch table. As with normal dispatching, if a handler is set for the driver object, all file objects must handle that fast I/O, even if the entry just points to DispatchFastIoDeviceControlFailure or a similar function.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 


## -returns



Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the MajorFunction identifier is valid.




## -remarks



If a major function handler is set for a driver object, all file objects must handle that major function, even if the entry just points to <b>KsDispatchInvalidDeviceRequest</b>.

This flag may be used to specify that the fast I/O entry should be set rather than the IRP-based entry.
