# KsStreamPointerDelete function


## -description


The<b> KsStreamPointerDelete </b>function deletes a clone stream pointer, releasing a reference on the frame to which this stream pointer referred.


## -parameters




### -param StreamPointer [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567139">KSSTREAM_POINTER</a> structure representing the clone stream pointer to delete. Must be a clone stream pointer; cannot be the leading or trailing edge stream pointer.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



If the frame to which <i>StreamPointer</i> points has no other references on it after deletion, it is completed. When the last frame in a given IRP is completed, the IRP is completed.

The leading edge and trailing edge stream pointers for a given queue and pin are special stream pointers that cannot be deleted.
