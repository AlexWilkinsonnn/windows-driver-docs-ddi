# _MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET structure


## -description


The MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET structure is used by a mount manager client with an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560473">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_NEXT_DRIVE_LETTER</a> request to furnish a nonpersistent target device name to the mount manager. 


## -struct-fields




### -field DeviceNameLength

Contains the length, in bytes, of device name. 


### -field DeviceName

Contains the nonpersistent target device name. 


## -remarks



The mount manager responds to the IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_NEXT_DRIVE_LETTER request by furnishing the client with a drive letter for the target device. 

Nonpersistent target names must contain the full path of a target object name in the system object tree. For example: "\Device\HarddiskVolume1". For a discussion of the difference between drive letters and nonpersistent target device names, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb37f862-70d6-4514-b481-16f664346422">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.
