## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The TCP chimney offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.]

The NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field Header

The header of the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure. The header is formatted as an 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure. The
     NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER structure contains the revision number of the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST
     structure, the type of offload state that immediately follows the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST
     structure in memory, and the size of the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure, including the
     header, in bytes. 
     

The 
     <b>Type</b> member of the NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER structure indicates the type of offload state, and by
     implication, the specific offload state structure (or structures) that immediately follow the
     NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure in memory.

The following OFFLOAD_STATE_TYPE values are supported:

     (neighbor, path, or TCP) indicated by the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the 
     <b>Header</b> member. NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structures that are linked through 
     <b>NextBlock</b> pointers are always at the same layer of the offload state. A 
     <b>NextBlock</b> value of <b>NULL</b> indicates that there is no additional next
     NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure at this level.


### -field DependentBlockList

A pointer to an NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure that is at a dependent layer of the
     offload state (a higher layer in the offload state tree). 
     





#### For TCP chimney offload:

The 
       <b>DependentBlockList</b> member of an NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure at the neighbor layer
       can point only to an NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure at the path layer. The 
       <b>DependentBlockList</b> member of an NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure at the path layer can
       point only to an NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure at the TCP layer. The 
       <b>DependentBlockList</b> member of an NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure at the TCP layer is
       always <b>NULL</b>.

A 
     <b>DependentBlockList</b> value of <b>NULL</b> indicates that there is no dependent
     NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure.


### -field _NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST

 


### -field Status

     or terminate offload operation that the offload target performed on the state associated with, or
     referenced by, the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure. Depending on the operation, NDIS writes
     one of the following NDIS_STATUS values to the 
     <b>Status</b> member:
     





#### NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS

Initiate offload: The underlying offload target successfully offloaded the state associated with
       the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure and the state associated with all of the immediately
       dependent PROTOCOL_MINIPORT_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structures.

       operation on the state associated with, or referenced by, the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST
       structure.



#### NDIS_STATUS_OFFLOAD_PARTIAL_SUCCESS

Initiate offload: The underlying offload target successfully offloaded the state associated with
       the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure, but failed to offload the state associated with one or
       more of the immediately dependent NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structures.

### -field NdisReserved

Reserved for use by NDIS.


### -field OffloadHandle

A pointer to an 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566705">NDIS_OFFLOAD_HANDLE</a> structure. The
     NDIS_OFFLOAD_HANDLE structure represents a protocol or intermediate driver's context for an offloaded
     state object.


### -field ProtocolReserved

Reserved for use by protocol drivers, which can use this area for their own purposes.


### -field MiniportReserved

Reserved for use by offload targets or the miniport portion of an intermediate driver.


### -field ImReserved

Reserved for use by intermediate drivers, which can use this area for their own purposes.


### -field Scratch

The protocol driver or intermediate driver can use this area for internal tracking. The
     information in this area is valid only while the driver has ownership of the 
     <b>
     NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIS</b> T.


### -field SourceHandle

This member is not significant for a protocol or intermediate driver. A protocol or intermediate
      driver must not modify this member.

When propagating the completion of a state-manipulation operation, an intermediate driver copies the      
      <b>SourceHandle</b> that it stored in its IM call entry to the 
      <b>SourceHandle</b> member of the 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ebc98e65-5d11-4c3d-aea1-dfad1434c093">
      NDIS_MINIPORT_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST</a> structure that it passes to the NdisMXxxComplete function.


### -field PortNumber

A port number that identifies a miniport adapter port. To assign a miniport adapter port number,
     call the 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562779">NdisMAllocatePort</a> function. A zero
     value identifies the default port of a miniport adapter. Use the default port if the miniport driver has
     not allocated ports for the specified adapter.


### -field NetBufferListChain

When the protocol or intermediate driver specifies a <b>NULL</b> value, 
      <b>NetBufferListChain</b> is not significant and can be ignored by the underlying driver or offload
      target.

When a protocol or intermediate driver specifies a non-<b>NULL</b> value, 
      <b>NetBufferListChain</b> points to a 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structure that can be a
      stand-alone structure or the first structure in a linked list of such structures. Each NET_BUFFER_LIST
      structure in the linked list describes one 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568376">NET_BUFFER</a> structure. The NET_BUFFER structure
      maps to a chain of memory descriptor lists (MDLs). The NET_BUFFER_LIST and associated structures are
      locked so that they remain resident in physical memory. However, they are not mapped into system
      memory.

The MDLs associated with the NET_BUFFER structures contain data that is being conveyed as part of a
      state-manipulation operation or the completion of such an operation. At present, the linked list can
      contain just one type of data: outstanding send data. For more information about send data, see 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/handling-outstanding-send-data-during-and-after-an-offload-operation">Handling
      Outstanding Send Data During and After an Offload Operation</a>.

An offload target or intermediate driver can pass outstanding send data to the overlying driver or
      host stack when terminating the offload of a TCP connection. In this case, the offload target specifies
      a non-<b>NULL</b> value for the 
      <b>NetBufferListChain</b> member when calling the 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d444eae5-2e7c-41f2-9fb2-55e172505cf6">
      NdisMTerminateOffloadComplete</a> function. If the offload target is not passing send data for a TCP
      connection that is being terminated, it specifies a <b>NULL</b> value for the 
      <b>NetBufferListChain</b> member.


## -remarks



An intermediate driver creates an NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure from an 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ebc98e65-5d11-4c3d-aea1-dfad1434c093">
    NDIS_MINIPORT_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST</a> structure when 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563771">propagating a
    state-manipulation operation</a>. When 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/propagating-the-completion-of-a-state-manipulation-operation">
    propagating the completion of such an operation</a>, an intermediate driver uses an
    NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure to construct an NDIS_MINIPORT_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST
    structure.

An NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure can be immediately followed in memory by an 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570939">offload state structure</a> that contains
    the state to be (or that has been) offloaded, queried, updated, invalidated, or terminated. The 
    <b>Type</b> member of the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure's 
    <b>Header</b> specifies the type of offload state, and by implication, the specific offload state
    structure (or structures) that follow the NDIS_PROTOCOL_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST structure in memory.
