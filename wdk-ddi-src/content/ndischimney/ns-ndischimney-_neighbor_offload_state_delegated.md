# _NEIGHBOR_OFFLOAD_STATE_DELEGATED structure


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The TCP chimney offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.]

The NEIGHBOR_OFFLOAD_STATE_DELGATED structure contains the delegated variable of a neighbor state
  object.


## -struct-fields




### -field Header

An 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569062">OFFLOAD_STATE_HEADER</a> structure. NDIS
     sets the 
     <b>Length</b> member of 
     <b>Header</b> to the size, in bytes, of the NEIGHBOR_OFFLOAD_STATE_DELEGATED structure. The 
     <b>RecognizedOptions</b> member of 
     <b>Header</b> is reserved.


### -field NicReachabilityDelta

The NIC's current time minus the 
     <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> is the last time that the offload target confirmed neighbor reachability (see
     forward reachability in RFC 2461). For information about how the offload target uses this variable, see 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563619">NdisMOffloadEventIndicate</a>. 
     <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> is measured in units of clock ticks.


## -remarks



The host stack provides initial values for the 
    <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> variable when it offloads the variable to the offload target. After it's been
    offloaded, the 
    <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> variable is owned and maintained by the offload target. Only the offload
    target can change the value of an offloaded 
    <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> variable. The offload target does not notify the host stack of changes to the
    values of an offloaded 
    <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> variable. However, the host stack can query the value of an offloaded 
    <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> variable, which causes NDIS to call the offload target's 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a583c4cb-53c1-4eff-bcfe-c962f736b1f8">MiniportQueryOffload</a> function.
    When the host stack terminates the offload of a neighbor state object by causing NDIS to call the offload
    target's 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1b808e3c-2d64-44c9-88d3-0a0311e1dc99">
    MiniportTerminateOffload</a> function, the offload target passes the value of the 
    <b>NicReachabilityDelta</b> variable in the terminated state object back to the host stack.

When passed to an offload target, a NEIGHBOR_OFFLOAD_STATE_DELEGATED structure is associated with an 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ebc98e65-5d11-4c3d-aea1-dfad1434c093">
    NDIS_MINIPORT_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST</a> structure, which contains a header that is formatted as an 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure. The 
    <b>Revision</b> member of the NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER structure, in this case, specifies the revision number of
    the NEIGHBOR_OFFLOAD_STATE_DELEGATED structure.
