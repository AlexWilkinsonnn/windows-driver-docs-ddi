# WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag macro


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]</p>

The **WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag** macro increments the power reference count for a specified framework device object and assigns the driver's current file name and line number to the reference. The macro also assigns a tag value to the reference.

## -syntax

```cpp
NTSTATUS WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag(
    _In_ WDFDEVICE Device,
    _In_ BOOLEAN WaitForD0,
    _In_ PVOID Tag
);
```

## -parameters




### -param Device [in]

A handle to a framework device object.


### -param WaitForD0 [in]

A Boolean value that indicates when **WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag** will return. If **TRUE**, it returns only after the specified device has entered the D0 device power state. If **FALSE**, the method returns immediately.

### -param Tag [in]

A driver-defined value that the framework stores as an identification tag for the power reference.

## -returns

If the operation succeeds, **WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag** returns STATUS_SUCCESS. If the driver calls **WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag** when the device is in its working (D0) state, the method returns STATUS_SUCCESS, but does not increment the power reference count.

Additional return values include:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_PENDING</strong></td>
<td><p>The device is being powered up asynchronously.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE</strong></td>
<td><p>The driver is not the power policy owner for the device.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>STATUS_POWER_STATE_INVALID</strong></td>
<td><p>A device failure occurred and the device cannot enter its D0 power state.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

The method might return other [NTSTATUS values](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697).

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.


## -remarks



If your driver calls **WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag** to increment a reference count, the driver must call [**WdfDeviceResumeIdleWithTag**](wdfdeviceresumeidlewithtag.md) to decrement the count.

Calling **WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag** instead of [**WdfDeviceStopIdle**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546921) provides additional information (tag value, line number, and file name) that you can view in Microsoft debuggers. **WdfDeviceStopIdleWithTag** uses the driver's current line number and file name.

You can view the tag, line number, and file name values by using the [**!wdftagtracker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566126) debugger extension. The debugger extension displays the tag value as both a pointer and a series of characters.

Use [**!wdfkd.wdfdevice**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565703) with verbose flags on and locate the link to [**!wdftagtracker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566126) in the output:

```cpp
kd> !wdfdevice <handle> f 
```
