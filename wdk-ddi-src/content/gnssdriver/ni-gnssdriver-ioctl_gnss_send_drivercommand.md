# IOCTL_GNSS_SEND_DRIVERCOMMAND IOCTL


## -description


The <b>IOCTL_GNSS_SEND_DRIVERCOMMAND</b> control code is used by the GNSS adapter to execute well-defined commands on the driver and also to set driver configuration parameters. Each call specifies a certain command type, and the associated data for the command (if one is applicable) through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn925107">GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM</a> structure.


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn925107">GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM</a> structure.


### -input-buffer-length

Set to sizeof(GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM).


### -output-buffer

Set to NULL.


### -output-buffer-length

Set to 0.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise, <b>Status</b> to the appropriate error condition as a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> code. 


## -remarks



The driver sets one of the following NTSTATUS values to indicate the result.

<ul>
<li>
STATUS_SUCCESS



</li>
<li>
Command Not Supported

</li>
<li>
Command Not Executed

</li>
<li>
Command Deferred

</li>
<li>
Command Failed

</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="GNSS_adapter_notes"></a><a id="gnss_adapter_notes"></a><a id="GNSS_ADAPTER_NOTES"></a>GNSS adapter notes</h3>
With the exception of a few commands, the GNSS adapter generally ignores any failures encountered in executing a specific command.

<h3><a id="GNSS_driver_notes"></a><a id="gnss_driver_notes"></a><a id="GNSS_DRIVER_NOTES"></a>GNSS driver notes</h3>
If the GNSS driver does not support a specific command, it indicates so. Drivers are not required to support all commands defined in this protocol. The driver should complete the I/O only after finishing executing of the command.
