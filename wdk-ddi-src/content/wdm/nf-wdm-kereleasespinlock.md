```cpp
NTKERNELAPI
VOID
KeReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel (
    _Inout_ PKSPIN_LOCK SpinLock
    );
```

## -parameters




### -param SpinLock [in]

Pointer to a KSPIN_LOCK spin lock for which the caller provides the storage.


### -param NewIrql [in, out]
Specifies the KIRQL value saved from the preceding call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551917">KeAcquireSpinLock</a>.





## -remarks



This call is a reciprocal to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551917">KeAcquireSpinLock</a>. The input <i>NewIrql</i> value must be the <i>OldIrql</i> returned by <b>KeAcquireSpinLock</b>.

For more information about spin locks, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563830">Spin Locks</a>.

Callers of this routine are running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. On return from <b>KeReleaseSpinLock</b>, IRQL is restored to the <i>NewIrql</i> value.
