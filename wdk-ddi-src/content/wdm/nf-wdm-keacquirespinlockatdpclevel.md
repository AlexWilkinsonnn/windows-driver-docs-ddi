# KeAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel macro


## -description


The <b>KeAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> routine acquires a spin lock when the caller is already running at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. 


## -parameters




### -param SpinLock [in, out]

Pointer to an initialized KSPIN_LOCK spin lock for which the caller must provide the storage.  The spin lock must be from non-paged pool.





## -remarks



Drivers call <b>KeAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> instead of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551917">KeAcquireSpinLock</a> for better driver performance if and only if they are already running at an IRQL of DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.

If a driver is running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL, it should call <b>KeAcquireSpinLock</b> to have IRQL raised by that routine. <b>KeAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> assumes the caller is already running at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL, so no raise is necessary.

The caller should release the spin lock with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553150">KeReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel</a> as quickly as possible.

For more information about spin locks, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563830">Spin Locks</a>.
