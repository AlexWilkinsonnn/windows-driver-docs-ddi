# PO_FX_DIRECTED_POWER_DOWN_CALLBACK callback function

## -description

Implemented by the client driver to handle driver-specific power down activities on behalf of DFx (Directed [PoFx](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/overview-of-the-power-management-framework)).

## -prototype

```
//Declaration

PO_FX_DIRECTED_POWER_DOWN_CALLBACK PoFxDirectedPowerDownCallback; 

// Definition

VOID PoFxDirectedPowerDownCallback 
(
	PVOID Context
	ULONG Flags
)
{...}

```


## -parameters

### -param Context: 

Supplies a pointer to the context passed in to [**PoFxRegisterDevice**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice).

### -param Flags: 

Reserved for future use.

## -returns

Returns VOID that ...

## -remarks

WDM drivers that register with PoFx for runtime idle power management support need to implement this callback to add DFx support.

Register your implementation of this callback function by setting the appropriate member of the [**PO_FX_DEVICE_V3**](ns-wdm-po_fx_device_v3.md) structure and then calling [**PoFxRegisterDevice**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice).

When Directed power down is requested, a driver needs to:

- Stop processing new work.
- Transition into low-power state immediately.
- Remain in that state until it receives a request to come back up.

This will typically involve (order and steps may vary with stack):

- Request a Dx IRP.
- <Once the Dx IRP arrivesâ€¦>
- Block I/O queues.
- Wait for in-progress operations to complete.
- If those operations are taking too long, possibly cancel them.
- Perform actions necessary to transition the device into Dx (e.g. save hardware state).
- Arm for wake as necessary.
- Complete the Directed power down transition by calling PoFxCompleteDirectedPowerDown().
- Remain in Dx until you get the Directed power up call.

The contract is very similar to S3/S4, although no actual S-IRPs are involved (see TBD).

Note that if a device hierarchy is involved, the directed power framework will ask the child devices to power down before the parent device. For a given parent device, both direct children, i.e. ones enumerated by the parent, as well as any indirect children due to power relations (https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-query-device-relations) are considered.
