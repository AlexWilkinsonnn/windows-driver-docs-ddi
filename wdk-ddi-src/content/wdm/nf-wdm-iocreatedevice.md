# IoCreateDevice function


## -description


The <b>IoCreateDevice</b> routine creates a device object for use by a driver.


## -parameters




### -param DriverObject [in]

Pointer to the driver object for the caller. Each driver receives a pointer to its driver object in a parameter to its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552644">DriverEntry</a> routine. WDM function and filter drivers also receive a driver object pointer in their <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540521">AddDevice</a> routines.


### -param DeviceExtensionSize [in]

Specifies the driver-determined number of bytes to be allocated for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9ea59994-1112-4ae5-96a8-fa0670694b53">device extension</a> of the device object. The internal structure of the device extension is driver-defined.


### -param DeviceName [in, optional]

Optionally points to a buffer containing a null-terminated Unicode string that names the device object. The string must be a full path name. WDM filter and function drivers do not name their device objects. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556420">Named Device Objects</a>.
     

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If a device name is not supplied (that is, <i>DeviceName</i> is <b>NULL</b>), the device object created by <b>IoCreateDevice</b> will not (and cannot) have a discretionary access control list (DACL) associated with it. For additional information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563698">Security Descriptors</a>.</div>
<div> </div>

### -param DeviceType [in]

Specifies one of the system-defined FILE_DEVICE_<i>XXX</i> constants that indicate the type of device (such as FILE_DEVICE_DISK or FILE_DEVICE_KEYBOARD) or a vendor-defined value for a new type of device. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563821">Specifying Device Types</a>.


### -param DeviceCharacteristics [in]

Specifies one or more system-defined constants, ORed together, that provide additional information about the driver's device. For a list of possible device characteristics, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543147">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>. For more information about how to specify device characteristics, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563818">Specifying Device Characteristics</a>. Most drivers specify FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN for this parameter.


### -param Exclusive [in]

Specifies if the device object represents an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0dd010e7-3e10-422a-adcb-8fe7df9e29ab">exclusive device</a>. Most drivers set this value to <b>FALSE</b>. For more information about exclusive access, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563827">Specifying Exclusive Access to Device Objects</a>.


### -param DeviceObject [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the newly created <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543147">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure. The <b>DEVICE_OBJECT</b> structure is allocated from nonpaged pool.


## -returns



<b>IoCreateDevice</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success, or the appropriate NTSTATUS error code on failure. A partial list of the failure codes returned by this function includes:




## -remarks



<b>IoCreateDevice</b> creates a device object and returns a pointer to the object. The caller is responsible for deleting the object when it is no longer needed by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549083">IoDeleteDevice</a>.

<b>IoCreateDevice</b> can only be used to create an unnamed device object, or a named device object for which a security descriptor is set by an INF file. Otherwise, drivers must use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548407">IoCreateDeviceSecure</a> to create named device objects. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542862">Creating a Device Object</a>. The caller is responsible for setting certain members of the returned device object. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547807">Initializing a Device Object</a> and the device-type-specific documentation for your device.

Be careful to specify the <i>DeviceType</i> and <i>DeviceCharacteristics</i> values in the correct parameters. Both parameters use system-defined FILE_<i>XXX</i> constants and some driver writers specify the values in the wrong parameters by mistake.

A remote file system that creates a named device object for a network redirector, and that registers using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547178">FsRtlRegisterUncProvider</a>, must specify FILE_REMOTE_DEVICE as one of the options in the <i>DeviceCharacteristics</i> parameter of <b>IoCreateDevice</b>.

Device objects for disks, tapes, CD-ROMs, and RAM disks are given a Volume Parameter Block (VPB) that is initialized to indicate that the volume has never been mounted on the device.

If a driver's call to <b>IoCreateDevice</b> returns an error, the driver should release any resources that it allocated for that device.
