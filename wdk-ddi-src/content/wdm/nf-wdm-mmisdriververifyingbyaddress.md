# MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress function


## -description


The <b>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</b> routine checks whether the kernel-mode  driver that is identified by the specified image address is being verified or calls a driver that is being verified by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557262">Driver Verifier</a>.


## -parameters




### -param AddressWithinSection [in]

A pointer to the virtual address within the driver image. <b>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</b> uses this address to determine which driver to check.


## -returns



<b>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the specified driver either is in the driver verification list or imports calls to entry points in a driver that is in the driver verification list. Otherwise, this routine returns <b>FALSE</b>.




## -remarks



A kernel-mode driver can call this routine to determine whether it or another driver is being monitored by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557262">Driver Verifier</a>. Driver Verifier monitors kernel-mode drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. To select drivers to be verified, you can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7cdf5277-7187-4e90-b22a-6f828f06e2fb">Verifier Command Line</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37a7d348-8b55-44f7-86d6-6b195704b9fd">Driver Verifier Manager</a>. For more information about adding drivers to the driver verification list, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a752dea1-f49c-4e58-9e56-6b54701c760e">Selecting Drivers to be Verified</a>.

A similar routine, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554578">MmIsDriverVerifying</a>, indicates whether a driver identified by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/497ee2dc-671d-408e-b228-16dc24532375">driver object</a> is being verified or calls a driver that is being verified.

Another related routine, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj552960">MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier</a>, indicates whether a driver represented by a driver object is in the list of drivers that are selected to be verified.

For example, if driver A has an import table through which it calls one or more entry points in driver B, and driver B is in the driver verification list, then <code>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress(Aobj)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b> and <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(Badr)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b>, where <code>Aobj</code> is a pointer to the driver object for A and <code>Badr</code> is an address in driver B. If driver A is not in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(Aobj)</code> returns <b>FALSE</b>. Even if driver B does not call entry points in any drivers that are in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress(Badr)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b> because driver B is in the driver verification list. If a driver C is not in the driver verification list and does not call entry points in any drivers that are in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress(Cadr)</code> and <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(Cobj)</code> both return <b>FALSE</b>.
