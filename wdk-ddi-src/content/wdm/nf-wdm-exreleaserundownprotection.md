# ExReleaseRundownProtection function


## -description


The <b>ExReleaseRundownProtection</b> routine releases run-down protection that the caller previously acquired by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569371">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> routine.


## -parameters




### -param RunRef [in, out]

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that was initialized by a previous call to the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569373">ExInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine. The run-down protection routines use this structure to track the run-down status of the associated shared object. This structure is opaque to drivers.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



A driver that calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569371">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> to acquire run-time protection for an object access is responsible for calling <b>ExReleaseRundownProtection</b> to release the run-time protection when the access is finished.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569382">Run-Down Protection</a>.
