# PBUILD_SCATTER_GATHER_LIST callback function


## -description


The <b>BuildScatterGatherList</b> routine prepares the system for a DMA operation, using a driver-supplied buffer to build the scatter/gather list.


## -parameters




### -param DmaAdapter [in]

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544062">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller.


### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the device object that represents the target device for the DMA operation.


### -param Mdl [in]

Pointer to the MDL that describes the buffer specified by the <b>MdlAddress</b> member of the current IRP.


### -param CurrentVa [in]

Pointer to the current virtual address in the MDL for the buffer to be mapped for a DMA transfer operation.


### -param Length [in]

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer to be mapped.


### -param ExecutionRoutine [in]

Pointer to a driver-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540513">AdapterListControl</a> routine, which is called at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL when the system DMA controller or bus-master adapter is available.


### -param Context [in]

Pointer to the driver-determined context passed to <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> when it is called.


### -param WriteToDevice [in]

Indicates the direction of the DMA transfer: <b>TRUE</b> for a transfer from the buffer to the device, and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.


### -param ScatterGatherBuffer [in]

Pointer to the caller-supplied buffer that the routine fills with a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563664">SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</a> structure.


### -param ScatterGatherLength








#### - ScatterGatherBufferLength [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer passed in the <i>ScatterGatherBuffer</i> parameter.


## -returns



<b>BuildScatterGatherList</b> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The operation is completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The system has insufficient map registers available for the transfer.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified <i>Length</i> is too big to fit within the buffer. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



<b>BuildScatterGatherList</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine can be called only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544071">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> with the <b>Version</b> member of the <i>DeviceDescription</i> parameter set to DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION2. If <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> returns <b>NULL</b>, the routine is not available on your platform.

<b>BuildScatterGatherList</b> performs the same operation as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546531">GetScatterGatherList</a>, except that it uses the buffer supplied in the <i>ScatterGatherBuffer</i> parameter to hold the scatter/gather list that it creates. In contrast, <b>GetScatterGatherList</b> dynamically allocates a buffer to hold the scatter/gather list. If insufficient memory is available to allocate the buffer, <b>GetScatterGatherList</b> can fail with a STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES error. Drivers that must avoid this scenario can preallocate a buffer to hold the scatter/gather list, and use <b>BuildScatterGatherList</b> instead.

A driver can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540716">CalculateScatterGatherList</a> routine to determine the size of buffer to allocate to hold the scatter/gather list.

The driver should retain the pointer to the scatter/gather list in <i>ScatterGatherBuffer</i> for use when the driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559967">PutScatterGatherList</a>. The driver must call <b>PutScatterGatherList</b> (which flushes the list) before it can access the data in the list.
