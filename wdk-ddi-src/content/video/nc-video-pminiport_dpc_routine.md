# PMINIPORT_DPC_ROUTINE callback function


## -description


<i>The HwVidDpcRoutine</i> function is a miniport driver-implemented callback that is called when a queued DPC gets scheduled.


## -parameters




### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the miniport driver's hardware device extension. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543119">Device Extensions</a>.


### -param Context [in]

Contains any miniport driver-supplied data this function may need. <i>Context</i> can be <b>NULL</b> if the DPC implementation does not require additional information.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The miniport driver queues this DPC by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570339">VideoPortQueueDpc</a>.

Because <i>HwVidDpcRoutine </i>is called at DISPATCH_LEVEL, it must not manipulate any pageable code or data. Further, this function must be in nonpaged memory and should complete its operations as quickly as possible.
