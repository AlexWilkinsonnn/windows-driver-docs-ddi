# UrsReportHardwareEvent function


## -description


Notifies the USB dual-role class extension about a new hardware event.


## -parameters




### -param Device [in]

A handle to the framework device object that the client driver retrieved in the previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545926">WdfDeviceCreate</a>.


### -param HardwareEvent [in]

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt628022">URS_HARDWARE_EVENT</a>-type value that indicates the type of event that occurred.


## -returns



The method returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return an appropriate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> error code. 




## -remarks



Before reporting any hardware events, the client driver for the dual-role controller must indicate to the class extension that the driver supports hardware events by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt628018">UrsSetHardwareEventSupport</a>.

The client driver cannot pass <b>UrsHardwareEventNone</b> as the <i>HardwareEvent</i> parameter value. That value is reserved for internal use.

The client driver must call this method to report any hardware event, such as ID-pin interrupts. Typically, in the driver's implementation of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6f28a66a-9c17-4020-bfe2-295c22af6ba7">EvtInterruptIsr</a> callback, the driver reads the  ID-pin state and reports the event to the class extension by calling this method.
