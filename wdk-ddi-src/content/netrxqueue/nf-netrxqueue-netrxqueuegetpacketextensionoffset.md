The **NetRxQueueGetPacketExtensionOffset** method retrieves the offset, in bytes, to a packet extension for all packets in a receive (Rx) queue.

## -parameters

### -param NetRxQueue
The receive queue object.

### -param ExtensionToGet
A pointer to a driver-allocated and initialized [NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_QUERY](../netadapterpacket/ns-netadapterpacket-_net_packet_extension_query.md) structure that contains information about the desired packet extension.

## -returns
Returns the offset to the desired extension from the beginning of the packet descriptor. This value is for all packets in this queue.

## -remarks
Client drivers typically call this method from their *[EvtNetAdapterCreateRxQueue](../netadapter/nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_create_txqueue.md)* callback function after queue creation. To prevent frequent offset queries, store the offset returned by this method in your queue context space.
