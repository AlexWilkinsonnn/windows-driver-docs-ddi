## -description


Support for this IOCTL by the mount manager clients is optional. It alerts the mount manager client that a persistent name associated with it has been deleted. The input for this IOCTL is the persistent name that was deleted. 


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The mount point manager places a variable-length structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562256">MOUNTDEV_NAME</a>, defined in <i>Mountmgr.h</i>, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. The mount manager inserts the persistent name just assigned at the address pointed to by the <i>Name</i> member of this structure. 


### -input-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTDEV_NAME).


### -output-buffer

None


### -output-buffer-length

None


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length


## -remarks

The implementer of this function must not thread synchronize and must not make blocking and/or Interprocess Communication (IPC) function calls.
