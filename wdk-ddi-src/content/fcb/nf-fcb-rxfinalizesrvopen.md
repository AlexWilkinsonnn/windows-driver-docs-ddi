# RxFinalizeSrvOpen function


## -description


<b>RxFinalizeSrvOpen</b> finalizes the given SRV_OPEN structure. The caller must have an exclusive lock on the FCB associated with the SRV_OPEN and either a shared or exclusive lock on the table lock of the NET_ROOT associated with the FCB.


## -parameters




### -param ThisSrvOpen [out]

A pointer to the SRV_OPEN structure to finalize.


### -param RecursiveFinalize [in]

The value indicating whether the finalization should be done recursively. 


### -param ForceFinalize [in]

The value indicating whether the finalization should be forced, regardless of the reference count. 

If <i>ForceFinalize</i> is <b>FALSE</b>, then the <b>NodeReferenceCount</b> member of the SRV_OPEN structure pointed to by <i>ThisSrvOpen</i> must be 0 for the SRV_OPEN to be finalized. 


## -returns



<b>RxFinalizeSrvOpen</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> on success or <b>FALSE</b> if the finalization did not occur: 




## -remarks



The <b>RxFinalizeSrvOpen</b> routine is not normally called by network mini-redirector drivers directly. RDBSS calls this routine internally when the reference count on the SRV_OPEN is decremented to 1. RDBSS also calls <b>RxFinalizeSrvOpen</b> when the <b>RxFinalizeNetFcb </b>routine is called with the <i>RecursiveFinalize</i> set to <b>TRUE</b>. RDBSS calls <b>RxFinalizeNetFcb</b> when an I/O request packet is received for IRP_MJ_CLOSE. This IRP is normally received by RDBSS in response to a user-mode application requesting a file close operation. It is also possible for another kernel driver to issue such an IRP. 

Before calling <b>RxFinalizeSrvOpen</b>, the caller must have acquired an exclusive lock on the FCB associated with the SRV_OPEN and acquired either a shared or exclusive lock on the table lock of the NET_ROOT associated with the FCB. 

If the <i>RecursiveFinalize</i> parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, then <b>RxFinalizeSrvOpen</b> will finalize any FOBX structures associated with this SRV_OPEN by calling <b>RxFinalizeNetFobx</b> with the <i>RecursiveFinalize </i>parameter set to <b>TRUE</b> and the <i>ForceFinalize</i> parameter. 

If the <b>FcbState</b> member of the associated FCB does not have the FCB_STATE_ORPHANED flag set, then <b>RxFinalizeSrvCall</b> will call the <b>MRxForceClosed</b> routine provided by the network mini-redirector to finalize the SRV_CALL. If the SRV_CALL structure was not originally allocated as part of creating the FCB, then the memory for the SRV_CALL structure will also be released.
