A **NET_PACKET_CHECKSUM** structure describes checksum information for a [NET_PACKET](ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md).

## -struct-fields

### -field Layer2
A bit field that specifies a flag from either **NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_ACTION** or **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_EVALUATION**. Targets the checksum field in the packet's layer 2 header.

### -field Layer3
A bit field that specifies a flag from either **NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_ACTION** or **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_EVALUATION**. Targets the checksum field in the packet's layer 3 header.

### -field Layer4
A bit field that specifies a flag from either **NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_ACTION** or **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_EVALUATION**. Targets the checksum field in the packet's layer 4 header.

### -field Reserved
Reserved for system use.

## -remarks
For more info about using this structure, see the **Checksum** member of [NET_PACKET](ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md).

For a transmit queue, the client specifies flag values from the **NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_ACTION** enumeration:

```c++
typedef enum _NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_ACTION
{
    NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_PASSTHROUGH                  = 0,
    NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_REQUIRED                     = 2,
} NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_ACTION;
```

For a receive queue, the client specifies flag values from the **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_EVALUATION** enumeration:

```c++
typedef enum _NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_EVALUATION
{
    NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_NOT_CHECKED                  = 0,
    NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_VALID                        = 1,
    NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_INVALID                      = 2,
} NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_EVALUATION;
```

In a transmit queue, the client cross-references the **Checksum** member with the [Layout](ns-netpacket-_net_packet_layout.md) member of a [NET_PACKET](ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md) in order to determine which hardware transmit checksum offloads need to be enabled. A **NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_ACTION** value of **NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_REQUIRED** means that the client should perform the checksum calculation for this layer.

In a receive queue, the client converts its hardware packet descriptors' receive checksum offload fields into **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_EVALUATION** values for each layer. **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_VALID** indicates that the hardware determined that the checksum value is correct, while **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_INVALID** means that it is incorrect. The default value is **NET_PACKET_RX_CHECKSUM_NOT_CHECKED**, which means that the checksum will be validated in software further up in the networking stack. The client should also fill out the [Layout](ns-netpacket-_net_packet_layout.md) member of the [NET_PACKET](ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md) structure.

The client driver must use NDIS functionality to enable checksum offloads. For more information, see [NDIS_TCP_IP_CHECKSUM_OFFLOAD](../ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_tcp_ip_checksum_offload.md).
