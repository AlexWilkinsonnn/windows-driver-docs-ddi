## -struct-fields

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME
A union that contains the **TCP** member.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.TCP
A structure that holds the TCP RSC information.
 
### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.TCP.RscTcpTimestampDelta
The absolute delta between the earliest and the latest TCP timestamp value seen in the sequence of coalesced segments comprising the Single Coalesced Unit (SCU).

### -field CoalescedSegmentCount
The number of data segments that were coalesced.
