# DXGKDDI_RECOMMENDMONITORMODES callback function


## -description


The <i>DxgkDdiRecommendMonitorModes</i> function inspects the monitor source mode set that is associated with a particular video present target and possibly adds modes to the set.


## -parameters




### -param hAdapter 

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5fd4046f-54c3-4dfc-8d51-0d9ebcde0bea">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.


### -param pRecommendMonitorModes

[in] A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557636">DXGKARG_RECOMMENDMONITORMODES</a> structure that contains function arguments.


## -returns



<i>DxgkDdiRecommendMonitorModes</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The function succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NO_MEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The function failed because it was unable to allocate enough memory.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

The miniport driver should pass through any error code that it gets from the operating system for which it does not have a fallback code path.




## -remarks



<i>DxgkDdiRecommendMonitorModes</i> should be made pageable.
