# DXGKDDI_OPENALLOCATIONINFO callback function


## -description


The <i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> function binds non-device-specific allocations that the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a28287d6-4dfa-4db4-92df-bbcd9379a5b2">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function created to allocations that are specific to the specified graphics context device.


## -parameters




### -param hDevice [in]

[in] A handle to the graphics context device that the allocations are bound from. The display miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a7027735-0ec4-4fad-81fb-1c3aca4ebf2d">DxgkDdiCreateDevice</a> function previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <b>hDevice</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557570">DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure. 


### -param pOpenAllocation [in]

[in] A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557609">DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION</a> structure that contains information about binding allocations.


## -returns



<i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>

<td width="60%">
<i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> successfully bound allocations to the graphics context device that the <i>hDevice</i> parameter specified.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>

<td width="60%">
Parameters that were passed to <i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> contained errors that prevented it from completing.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NO_MEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> could not allocate memory that was required for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_GRAPHICS_DRIVER_MISMATCH</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The display miniport driver is not compatible with the user-mode display driver that initiated the call to <i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> (that is, supplied private data to the display miniport driver). 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> function to bind nondevice-specific allocations that the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a28287d6-4dfa-4db4-92df-bbcd9379a5b2">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function created to allocations that are specific to the graphics context device that the <i>hDevice</i> parameter specifies. The display miniport driver binds allocations to a device so the driver can keep track of allocation data that is specific to a device. 

The display miniport driver can bind an allocation to any device that any process (on the same graphics adapter) created and not just to a device in the creating process. 

When <i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS, the driver sets the <b>hDeviceSpecificAllocation</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561983">DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure for each allocation to a non-NULL value. The DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO structure for each allocation is an element of the array that the <b>pOpenAllocation</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557609">DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION</a> structure specifies.  

The driver can modify the allocation private driver data that is passed in the <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561983">DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure only when the allocation is created (which is indicated when the <b>Create</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557609">DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION</a> structure is set). The driver should determine that it can only read the allocation private driver data when the allocation is opened (that is, when the <b>Create</b> bit-field flag is not set).

<i>DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</i> should be made pageable.
