# DXGKDDI_CREATEDEVICE callback function


## -description


The <i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> function creates a graphics context device that is subsequently used in calls to the display miniport driver's device-specific functions.


## -parameters




### -param hAdapter [in]

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5fd4046f-54c3-4dfc-8d51-0d9ebcde0bea">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.


### -param pCreateDevice [in, out]

[in/out] A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557570">DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure that describes the graphics context device.


## -returns



<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> successfully created the graphics context device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NO_MEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> could not allocate memory that was required for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> function to create a graphics context device that the graphics subsystem subsequently passes in calls to the display miniport driver. The driver uses a device to hold a collection of rendering state. The graphics subsystem can create multiple devices in the same process on a given graphics processing unit (GPU) adapter. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The number of devices that can simultaneously exist is limited only by available system memory. That is, a driver cannot have a hard-coded maximum device limit.</div>
<div> </div>
Generally, devices are independent of each other; in other words, resources that are created in one device cannot be referenced or accessed by resources that are created in another device. However, cross-process resources are an exception to this rule. 

<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> should be made pageable.
