# PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER callback function

## -description

The PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER is implemented by the client driver to handle event bufer overflows from the counters resources acquired through the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md">HalAllocateHardwareCounters</a> routine.

## -prototype

```
//Declaration

PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER PphysicalCounterEventBufferOverflowHandler;

// Definition

VOID PphysicalCounterEventBufferOverflowHandler
(
	PVOID EventBuffer
	SIZE_T EntrySize
	SIZE_T NumberOfEntries
	HANDLE OwningHandle
)
{...}

```

## -parameters

### -param EventBuffer:

Provides a pointer to the event buffer containing the event entires.

### -param EntrySize:

Provides the size of an individual event entry.

### -param NumberOfEntries:

Provides the number of entries available

### -param OwningHandle:

Provides the <b>HANDLE</b> corresponding to the resource set the event buffer belongs to.

## -returns

None.

## -remarks

Register your implementation of this callback function by adding a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558796">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> with a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558797">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</a> of ResourceTypeEventBuffer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558798">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST</a> and then calling <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md">HalAllocateHardwareCounters</a>.

This callback is called at IRQL = PROFILE_LEVEL. This means it must always be memory-resident. The callback should return as quickly as possible and should not attempt to do any of the following.

* Acquire or release spin locks.

* Access paged pool that is not locked in memory

* Call a pageable routine.

The callback does not need to handle clearing any overflow registers as it will be handled by the HAL.
