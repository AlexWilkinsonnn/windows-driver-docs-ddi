# _PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes the counter resources available on the platform.


## -struct-fields




### -field Type

Indicates the type of counter resource described by the structure. Set this parameter to one of the following <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558797">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</a> enumeration constants:

<ul>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeSingle</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeRange</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeExtendedCounterConfiguration</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeOverflow</b>

</li>
</ul>

### -field Flags

No flags are currently defined. Set this member to zero.


### -field u

A union that can contain a <b>CounterIndex</b>, <b>ExtendedRegisterAddress</b>, or <b>Range</b> value.


### -field u.CounterIndex

A physical counter index. 


### -field u.ExtendedRegisterAddress

An extended configuration register address. 


### -field u.Range

A range of counter indexes. 


### -field u.Range.Begin

The starting counter index of a block of contiguous counters. 


### -field u.Range.End

The ending counter index of a block of contiguous counters. 


## -remarks



Most processors have performance monitor units that contain a number of hardware counters for measuring various aspects of system performance. The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes a counter resource, which can be a single hardware counter, a block of contiguous counters, or a counter overflow interrupt. This structure's <b>Type</b> member indicates which type of counter resource is described by the structure.

To specify a set of counter resources, a kernel-mode client can provide an array of <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures. A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558798">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST</a> structure serves as a header for the array. The client can allocate and free the set of counter resources described by the array as a single unit.
