## -remarks



The caller must have DELETE access to a given file to call ZwSetInformationFile with <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_DELETE</b>. 

Normally a file marked for deletion is not actually deleted until all open handles for the file have been closed and the link count for the file is zero.  When marking a file for deletion using <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_POSIX_SEMANTICS</b>, the link gets removed from the visible namespace as soon as the POSIX delete handle has been closed, but the file’s data streams remain accessible by other existing handles until the last handle has been closed.
