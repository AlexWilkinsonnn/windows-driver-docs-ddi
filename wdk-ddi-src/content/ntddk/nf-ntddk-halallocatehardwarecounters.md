# HalAllocateHardwareCounters function


## -description


The <b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> routine allocates a set of hardware performance counters.


## -parameters




### -param GroupAffinty

<p>Reserved for future use. Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b>.</p>


### -param GroupCount [in]

Reserved for future use. Set this parameter to zero.


### -param ResourceList [in]

Reserved for future use. Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b>.


### -param CounterSetHandle [out]

A pointer to a location into which the routine writes a handle to the allocated counter resources. To release these resources later, the caller must pass this handle to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546593">HalFreeHardwareCounters</a> routine. If the requested counter resources are unavailable, <b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> sets *<i>CounterSetHandle</i> = <b>NULL</b> and returns STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.


## -returns



<b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Possible error return values include the following status codes.

<table>

<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td width="40%">

<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>

<td width="60%">
The caller specified an invalid parameter value.

## -remarks



Most processors have performance monitor units (PMUs) that contain a number of hardware counters. Software tools use these counters to monitor various aspects of system performance. Typically, such a tool consists of a custom kernel-mode driver to program the counters and a user-mode application that communicates with the driver.

If more than one such tool is installed on a computer, the associated drivers must avoid trying to use the same hardware counters simultaneously. To avoid such resource conflicts, all drivers that use counter resources should use the <b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> and <b>HalFreeHardwareCounters</b> routines to coordinate their sharing of these resources.

A counter resource is a single hardware counter, a block of contiguous counters, or a counter overflow interrupt in a PMU.

Before configuring the counters, a driver can call the <b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> routine to acquire exclusive access to a set of counter resources. After the driver no longer needs these resources, it must free the resources by calling the <b>HalFreeHardwareCounters</b> routine.

In Windows 8 and Windows 7, a successful call to <b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> grants the caller exclusive access to all counter resources in the performance monitor unit of a single-processor system. In a multiprocessor system, a successful call grants the caller exclusive access to all counter resources in all processors in the system. Future versions of this routine might provide more fine-grained allocation of counter resources.

Virtualization software typically does not virtualize hardware performance counters. Thus, these counters might not be available in a virtual machine, regardless of whether <b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> returns a status code of STATUS_SUCCESS. For example, hardware performance counters are not available in a Hyper-V virtual machine, but <b>HalAllocateHardwareCounters</b> might still return STATUS_SUCCESS.
