# PHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_CONFIGURATION structure

## -description

The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_CONFIGURATION</b> structure describes the event buffer configuration on the platform.

## -struct-fields

### -field OverflowHandler

A pointer to the <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-pphysical_counter_event_buffer_overflow_handler.md">PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER</a> routine that will be called when the event buffer entries reach a threshold in the event buffer.


### -field CustomEventBufferEntrySize

The size of the event buffer entries, for custom event buffer sizes. This should be set to 0.


### -field EventThreshold

The number of events to be recorded before the EventBufferOverflowHandler is invoked. This value is used as a maximum threshold. The actual number of events will depend on the number of actors using event buffer profiling.

## -remarks

Most processors have performance monitor units that contain a number of hardware counters for measuring various aspects of system performance. The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_CONFIGURATION</b> structure is used within the <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure to describe the configuration for event buffer resources.
