Specifies a client driver's power capabilities.

## -enum-fields

### -field NET_ADAPTER_POWER_WAKE_PACKET_INDICATION : 
If this flag is set, the network adapter must be able to save the received packet that caused the adapter to generate a wake-up event.

If this flag is set, the client driver must be able to do the following with this packet after the network adapter transitions to a full-power state:

- The client driver must be able to indicate the packet by calling [NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists](../ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists.md). 
- The client driver must be able to issue an NDIS_STATUS_PM_WAKE_REASON status indication and must pass the packet with the indication. To indicate the received packet, the client calls **NetAdapterWdmGetNdisHandle**, then calls [NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists](../ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists.md).

For more information about this power management capability, see [NDIS Wake Reason Status Indications](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/ndis-wake-reason-status-indications).

### -field NET_ADAPTER_POWER_SELECTIVE_SUSPEND : 
Specifies that NetAdapterCx should suspend an idle network adapter by transitioning the adapter to a low-power state.

## -remarks

The **NET_ADAPTER_POWER_FLAGS** enumeration is used to specify power capabilities in the [NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_power_capabilities.md) structure.

The client driver passes an initialized [NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_power_capabilities.md) structure as an input parameter value to [NetAdapterSetPowerCapabilities](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetpowercapabilities.md).
