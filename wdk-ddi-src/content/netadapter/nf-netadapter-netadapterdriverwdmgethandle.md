A WDF client driver calls **NetAdapterDriverWdmGetHandle** to get a handle that can be used to call NDIS APIs.

## -parameters

### -param Driver
A handle to the driver's framework driver object, obtained from a previous call to [WdfDriverCreate](../wdfdriver/nf-wdfdriver-wdfdrivercreate.md).

## -returns
**NetAdapterDriverWdmGetHandle** returns a WDM handle to the client driver. The framework's verifier reports an error if no corresponding WDM handle exists.
