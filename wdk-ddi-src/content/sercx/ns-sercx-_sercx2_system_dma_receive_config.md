# _SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG structure


## -description


The <b>SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG</b> structure contains information that version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) uses to configure a new system-DMA-receive object.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of this structure. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265279">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> method uses this member to determine which version of the structure the caller is using. The size of this structure might change in future versions of the Sercx.h header file.


### -field MaximumTransferLength

The default maximum size, in bytes, that the serial controller can handle in a single system DMA transfer. If the size of the buffer in the read (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a>) request is larger than this maximum size, SerCx2 uses multiple DMA transfers to handle the request, and limits each transfer to the maximum length.


### -field MinimumTransactionLength

The minimum length, in bytes, of a system-DMA-receive transaction. If the length of the buffer in a read request is less than this minimum length, SerCx2 uses programmed I/O (PIO) for the transaction.


### -field DmaAlignment

DMA alignment requirement. Specifies how the starting address of a transfer in a system-DMA-receive transaction must be aligned in memory. Set this member to the appropriate FILE_<i>XXX</i>_ALIGNMENT constant in the Wdm.h header file. For example, FILE_WORD_ALIGNMENT indicates that the starting DMA address must be aligned to two-byte boundary in memory, FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT indicates that the address must be aligned to a four-byte boundary, and so on. SerCx2 does not support FILE_BYTE_ALIGNMENT. The minimum transfer unit (MTU) of the system DMA adapter should be greater than or equal to the required alignment. For example, if the MTU is four bytes, <b>DmaAlignment</b> must be at least FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT.


### -field MaximumScatterGatherFragments

The maximum number of buffer fragments that can be specified in the scatter/gather list for a DMA transfer in a system-DMA-receive transaction.


### -field DmaWidth

The width of the data register at the address specified by <b>DeviceAddress</b>. Possible values are <b>Width8Bits</b>, <b>Width16Bits</b>, <b>Width32Bits</b>, and <b>Width64Bits</b>.


### -field DeviceAddress

The translated address from which the DMA controller transfers. For more information, see the description of the <b>DeviceAddress</b> member in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439495">WDF_DMA_SYSTEM_PROFILE_CONFIG</a>.


### -field DmaDescriptor

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/96bf7bab-b8f5-439c-8717-ea6956ed0213">CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that describes the system DMA resource to use for receive transactions. The serial controller driver gets this structure from the raw resource list it receives in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a3d4a983-8a75-44be-bd72-8673d89f9f87">EvtDevicePrepareHardware</a> callback that starts the serial controller.


### -field MinimumTransferUnitOverride

An override value to use in place of the default minimum transfer unit. The number of bytes specified by an element in a scatter/gather list must be an integer multiple of the minimum transfer unit. A value of zero indicates that the default minimum transfer unit should be used. For more information, see the description of the <b>MinimumTransferUnit</b> member in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450995">DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_V1</a>.


### -field Exclusive

Whether to use system-DMA-receive transactions exclusively to handle write (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a>) requests. Set to <b>TRUE</b> to indicate that read requests should use system-DMA-receive transactions exclusively. Set to <b>FALSE</b> to indicate that read requests can use a combination of system-DMA-receive transactions and PIO-receive transactions.

Set this member to <b>TRUE</b> only if the minimum transfer unit for system-DMA-receive transactions is one byte, the minimum transaction length is one byte, and the read buffer for the transaction can start on any byte boundary in memory.

If <b>Exclusive</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, the <b>MinimumTransferUnitOverride</b>, <b>DmaAlignment</b>, and <b>MinimumTransactionLength</b> members must be zero.

Regardless of the value of this member, PIO-receive transactions are used to save any unread data in the receive FIFO before the serial controller exits the D0 device power state to enter a low-power state.


### -field EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveInitializeTransaction

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/34E016AF-439C-44CC-A2AE-78CD7B2B5443">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveInitializeTransaction</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function.


### -field EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/66B15ED1-583D-418C-90C5-25BBBCEE7B5A">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function.


### -field EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveConfigureDmaChannel

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7B5C7151-851C-4F56-BCC5-3AF47F298B23">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveConfigureDmaChannel</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function.


### -field EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E2B7FE14-1D06-48E7-95FB-C103358340EA">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function. However, a driver that implements this function must also implement an <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification</i> function.


### -field EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7C88F794-0C2B-4715-B09A-2AA49414F18A">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function. However, a driver that implements this function must also implement an <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> function.


## -remarks



The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265279">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> method accepts a pointer to a <b>SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG</b> structure as an input parameter. Before calling <b>SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</b>, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265340">SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG_INIT</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265341">SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG_INIT_NEW_DATA_NOTIFICATION</a> function to initialize this structure.
