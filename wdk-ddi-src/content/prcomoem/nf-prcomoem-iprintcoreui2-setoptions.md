## -parameters




### -param poemuiobj [in]

Pointer to the current context, an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559571">OEMUIOBJ</a> structure.


### -param dwFlags [in]

Specifies whether the core driver is to resolve conflicts. This parameter must be set to one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>

## -remarks



This method is supported only for Windows XP Pscript5 plug-ins, not for Unidrv plug-ins.

This method is called to set the driver's feature settings using a list of feature/option keyword pairs. The caller can access the resultant feature settings using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553069">IPrintCoreUI2::GetOptions</a> method. 

If this method returns any value other than S_OK, then it did not make any change in the driver's feature settings.

The <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i> input buffer must be constructed in the same way as the output buffer of the <b>IPrintCoreUI2::GetOptions</b> method. That is, the feature/option keyword pairs must be in MULTI_SZ format, and each item in the list is separated from the next by a null character. A pair of null characters terminates the list.

If the input buffer contains a feature keyword or its option keyword that is not recognized, or the feature is recognized but not supported in the current sticky mode (see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b7f79841-f82c-4a60-9c2f-58772a65a5eb">Replacing Driver-Supplied Property Sheet Pages</a>), then the feature/option pair is ignored, and the current option for that feature continues to be in effect.

This method is supported only for UI plug-ins that fully replace the core driver's standard UI pages, and is supported only during the UI plug-in's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554173">IPrintOemUI::DocumentPropertySheets</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554165">IPrintOemUI::DevicePropertySheets</a> functions, and their property sheet callback routines.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c8b5c235-0b74-47c8-b6ba-eba810a8467b">Using GetOptions and SetOptions</a>.
