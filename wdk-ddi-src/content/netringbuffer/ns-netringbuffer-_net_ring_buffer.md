Specifies a buffer comprised of one or more [**NET_PACKET**](../netpacket/../packet/ns-packet-_net_packet.md) or [**NET_FRAGMENT**](../fragment/ns-fragment-_net_fragment.md) structures.

## -struct-fields

### -field OSReserved1
Reserved. Client drivers must not read or write to this value.
 
### -field ElementStride
A read-only byte offset from the start of one [NET_PACKET](../netpacket/../packet/ns-packet-_net_packet.md) to the start of the next. Use `((BYTE*)p + ElementStride)` to obtain the address of the next element.
 
### -field NumberOfElements
A read-only value that indicates the number of packets in the ring buffer, which is always a power of two, and greater than one.
 
### -field ElementIndexMask
A read-only UINT32 mask that is defined as (**NumberOfElements** - 1). The client can use this value to calculate an index that wraps around the ring buffer. Use the identity `(x % NumberofElements) == (x & ElementIndexMask)`.
 
### -field BeginIndex
Specifies the index of the first element owned by the client driver in the inclusive range [0, **NumberOfElements** - 1]. While a client driver can modify this value directly, it typically uses helper routines like [NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets](../netadapterpacket/nf-netadapterpacket-netringbufferreturncompletedpackets.md) instead.
 
### -field NextIndex
Specifies the index of the next element that needs processing. For optional use by the client driver. While a client driver can modify this value directly, it typically calls [NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket](../netadapterpacket/nf-netadapterpacket-netringbufferadvancenextpacket.md) instead.
 
### -field EndIndex
Specifies the read-only index of the last element that is owned by the client driver in the inclusive range [0, **NumberOfElements** - 1].
 
### -field NetAdapterScratch
A pointer to a buffer that the client driver may use for any purpose.
 
### -field OSReserved2
Reserved. Client drivers must not read or write to this value.
 
### -field Buffer
A byte array that contains the elements in the ring buffer. Typically, a client driver calls [NetRingBufferGetPacketAtIndex](../netadapterpacket/nf-netadapterpacket-netringbuffergetpacketatindex.md) to access packets in the ring buffer.

## -remarks
The **NET_RING_BUFFER** structure is a generic ring buffer, optimized for efficient access from a single thread. A **NET_RING_BUFFER** contains [**NET_PACKET**](../netpacket/../packet/ns-packet-_net_packet.md) or [**NET_FRAGMENT**](../fragment/ns-fragment-_net_fragment.md) elements.
