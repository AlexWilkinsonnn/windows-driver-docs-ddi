Calculates the number of elements contained in a range of the specified net ring buffer.

## -parameters

### -param RingBuffer
A pointer to a [NET_RING_BUFFER](ns-netringbuffer-_net_ring_buffer.md).

### -param StartIndex
The inclusive start of the range to measure.

### -param EndIndex
The exclusive end of the range to measure.

## -returns
The number of elements in the given range.

## -remarks
For example, consider a net ring buffer containing a total of 8 elements. Index values for the elements are zero through 7. The number of elements in the range [1, 4) is 3. This is because the EndIndex value is not included, so the range includes elements at index values 1, 2, and 3.

Similarly, the range [4, 1) includes elements at index values 4, 5, 6, 7, and 0 (looping back to the beginning of the ring), for a total of 5 elements.

Finally, note that an empty range like [2, 2) returns zero elements.
