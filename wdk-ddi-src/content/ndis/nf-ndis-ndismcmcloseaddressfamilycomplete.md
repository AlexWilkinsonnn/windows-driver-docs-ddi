# NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete macro


## -description


<b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM
  driver returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to close the AF.


## -parameters




### -param _S_

The caller sets this to NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS.

### -param _H_

Specifies the NDIS-supplied handle passed to the MCM driver's 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7422c205-bc41-4121-b430-ff9e6b49dc2e">ProtocolCmOpenAf</a> function when this
     client originally opened the address family.

## -remarks



An MCM driver must call 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> if its 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a7a02813-62e4-49c5-abb6-a90f4e092b9f">ProtocolCmCloseAf</a> function previously
    returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING for the given 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i> . The client, which initiated the pended close-AF operation with a call to 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561626">NdisClCloseAddressFamily</a>, cannot
    release the resources it allocated to track communications on the AF until the MCM driver's call to 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b>.

A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7597e124-34e4-4326-98b3-c65dbe90ae6f">
    ProtocolClCloseAfComplete</a> function.

The MCM driver cannot subsequently use the 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i>, which is invalid for the MCM driver when 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> returns control.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS
    as protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> instead.
