# NdisMCmDispatchIncomingCall macro


## -description


<b>NdisMCmDispatchIncomingCall</b> informs the client of an incoming call on a SAP previously registered by
  that client with the MCM driver.


## -parameters




### -param _SH_

Specifies the handle identifying the SAP. NDIS set up this handle when the client originally
     called 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561648">NdisClRegisterSap</a>, and the MCM driver
     obtained this handle as an input parameter to its 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3e3e7a0e-a8d2-40b2-895b-187d24867080">
     ProtocolCmRegisterSap</a> function.

### -param _VH_

Specifies the handle identifying the VC, created with 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562812">NdisMCmCreateVc</a> when the MCM driver
     processes the incoming call offer directed to this registered SAP.

### -param _CP_

Pointer to a structure of type 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545384">CO_CALL_PARAMETERS</a> that specifies the call
     and media parameters for the VC.

## -remarks



Before calling 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchIncomingCall</b>, an MCM driver has already done the following:

<ul>
<li>
Identified the target SAP, previously registered by a particular client, for the call (actually, a
      request to make a connection) that it received over the network

</li>
<li>
Created a VC for the incoming call with 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562812">NdisMCmCreateVc</a>


</li>
<li>
Possibly negotiated about acceptable call parameters over the network, or accepted the call
      parameters sent from the remote node

</li>
<li>
Activated the VC with 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562792">NdisMCmActivateVc</a> to notify NDIS that
      it is ready for transfers on the VC in accord with the negotiated or accepted call parameters

</li>
</ul>
The MCM driver's call to 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchIncomingCall</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <i>ProtocolClIncomingCall</i> function, within which the client either accepts or rejects the requested
    connection. After deciding whether to accept the connection, the client calls 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561632">NdisClIncomingCallComplete</a>,
    which, in turn, calls the MCM driver's 
    <i>ProtocolCmIncomingCallComplete</i> function. If the client accepted the call, the MCM driver next calls    
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b47976ad-fdde-48cb-bb30-4eaf25489143">
    NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</a>. Otherwise, it deactivates (and possibly deletes) the VC it created,
    after notifying the remote node that the offered call was rejected.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support call 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchIncomingCall</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmDispatchIncomingCall</b> instead.
