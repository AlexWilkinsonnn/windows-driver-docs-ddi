# NDIS_SWITCH_REPORT_FILTERED_NET_BUFFER_LISTS callback function


## -description



The <i>ReportFilteredNetBufferLists</i> function reports on one or more network packets that were dropped or excluded from port delivery by the extensible switch extension. Each network packet is defined through a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structure.






## -parameters




### -param NdisSwitchContext [in]

An NDIS_SWITCH_CONTEXT value that contains the handle of the extensible switch module to which the Hyper-V extensible switch extension is attached. When the extension calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598204">NdisFGetOptionalSwitchHandlers</a>,  this handle is returned through the <i>NdisSwitchContext</i> parameter.


### -param ExtensionGuid [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564879">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure that contains the GUID of the extension. NDIS specifies this GUID in the <b>FilterModuleGuidName</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565481">NDIS_FILTER_ATTACH_PARAMETERS</a> structure. NDIS passes a pointer to this structure in the <i>AttachParameters</i> parameter when it calls the extension's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nc-ndis-filter_attach">FilterAttach</a> function.


### -param ExtensionFriendlyName [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564879">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure that contains the user-friendly name of the extension. This name is defined by the <b>DisplayName</b>     entry in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/inf-addservice-directive">AddService Directive</a>
of the extension's INF file.


### -param PortId [in]

An NDIS_SWITCH_PORT_ID value that specifies an extensible switch port. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -param Flags [in]

A UINT32 value. When the NDIS_SWITCH_REPORT_FILTERED_NBL_FLAGS_IS_INCOMING flag is specified, it indicates that the <b>PortId</b> member defines the source of the dropped packet. When it is not specified, the PortId member defines the destination extensible switch port. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -param NumberOfNetBufferLists [in]

A UINT32 value that contains the number of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structures that is specified by the <i>NetBufferLists</i> parameter.


### -param NetBufferLists [in]

A pointer to a linked list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structures. 


### -param FilterReason [in, optional]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564879">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure that contains a user-friendly description of the reason for the drop or exclusion of the packets. For more information, see the Remarks section.


## -returns



This callback function does not return a value.




## -remarks



When the extension excludes the delivery of a packet to an extensible switch port, it must call <i>ReportFilteredNetBufferLists</i>. When this function is called, the extensible switch module increments counters and logs events for the dropped or excluded packets. When it logs an event for a dropped or excluded set of packets, the extensible switch module uses the user-friendly description that is specified by the <i>FilterReason</i> parameter.

The extension can exclude the delivery of a packet in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>
The extension completes the packet instead of forwarding it on through the extensible switch driver stack. For example, the extension can call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562618">NdisFSendNetBufferListsComplete</a> to drop a packet that it inspected when NDIS calls its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1b3fc0c8-95da-47e5-8ff1-b7967f5148e7">FilterSendNetBufferLists</a> function. 

</li>
<li>
 The extension changes the destination ports for a packet. For example, the extension must call <i>ReportFilteredNetBufferLists</i> if it sets the <b>IsExcluded</b> member to <b>TRUE</b> in the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598224">NDIS_SWITCH_PORT_DESTINATION</a> structure for a destination port of the packet. 

For more information on how to exclude packet delivery to extensible switch ports, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/04BF02A6-360F-482E-A86B-31232AFCB778">Excluding Packet Delivery to Extensible Switch Destination Ports</a>.

</li>
</ul>
The extension must follow these guidelines when it calls <i>ReportFilteredNetBufferLists</i>:

<ul>
<li>
The <i>NetBufferLists</i> parameter specified a linked-list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568388">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structures. All of the packets specified by these structures must have been received from or sent to the same port, and were dropped or excluded for the same reason. 

</li>
<li>
If the packet is being dropped due to policy based on the source port, the NDIS_SWITCH_REPORT_FILTERED_NBL_FLAGS_IS_INCOMING flag must be specified.  The extension must also set the <i>PortId</i> parameter to the identifier of the port from which the packet was received.

</li>
<li>
If the packet is being dropped due to policy based on the destination port, the NDIS_SWITCH_REPORT_FILTERED_NBL_FLAGS_IS_INCOMING flag must not be specified.  The extension must also set the <i>PortId</i> parameter to the identifier of the port to which the packet was to be sent.

</li>
</ul>
