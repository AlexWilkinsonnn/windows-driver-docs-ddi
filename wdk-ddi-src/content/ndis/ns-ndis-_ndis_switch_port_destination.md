# _NDIS_SWITCH_PORT_DESTINATION structure


## -description


The <b>NDIS_SWITCH_PORT_DESTINATION</b> structure specifies the Hyper-V extensible switch destination port to which a packet will be delivered.


## -struct-fields




### -field PortId

An NDIS_SWITCH_PORT_ID value that specifies the unique identifier of the destination port on the extensible switch.


### -field NicIndex

An NDIS_SWITCH_NIC_INDEX value that specifies the index of the network adapter that is connected to the  extensible switch port specified by the <b>PortId</b> member.

For more information on NDIS_SWITCH_NIC_INDEX values, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/969333DA-0282-474B-8D56-72CD623C5329">Network Adapter Index Values</a>.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This member must specify the index value of a network adapter that is in a connected state. Index values for network adapters that are in a created or disconnected state cannot be specified. For more information about network connection states, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1E2075E3-D7CC-4364-ABB2-D5969DB361B5">Hyper-V Extensible Switch Port and Network Adapter States</a>.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field IsExcluded

If this member is set to TRUE, the packet will not be delivered to the
    destination port.



### -field PreserveVLAN

If this member is set to TRUE, the 802.1Q virtual local area network (VLAN) information will be preserved when the packet is delivered to the destination port.  



### -field PreservePriority

If this member is set to TRUE, the 802.1Q priority information will be preserved when the packet is delivered to the destination port.  



### -field Reserved

This member is reserved for future use by NDIS.
