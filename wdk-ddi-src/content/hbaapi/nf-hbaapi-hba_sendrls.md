# HBA_SendRLS function


## -description


The <b>HBA_SendRLS</b> WMI routine sends a read link error status block (RLS) request through the indicated local port to the indicated remote port to retrieve a link error status block associated with the remote port.


## -parameters




### -param HbaHandle [in]

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557097">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA through which the request is sent. 


### -param HbaPortWWN [in]

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the local port through which the request is sent. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. 


### -param DestWWN [in]

Contains a 64-bit WWN that uniquely identifies the destination port to which the request is sent. 


### -param pRspBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the output data of the RLS request, if the request succeeds. If the destination port rejects the request, this buffer holds the link service reject (LS_RJT) payload data. If the amount of returned data exceeds the buffer size specified in <i>pRspBufferSize</i>, the data is truncated to the buffer size<i>. </i>The payload data is in big-endian format (higher order bytes are in lower addresses). 


### -param pRspBufferSize [in, out]

Indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pRspBuffer</i>. A size of 28 bytes is sufficient for the largest response.


## -returns



The <b>HBA_SendRLS</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_SendRLS</b> returns one of the following values.
