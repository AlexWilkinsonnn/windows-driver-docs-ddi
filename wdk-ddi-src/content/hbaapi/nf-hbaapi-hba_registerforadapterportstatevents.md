# HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortStatEvents function


## -description


The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortStatEvents</b> routine registers the indicated user callback routine to call when a port statistics event occurs. 


## -parameters




### -param callback

Pointer to a callback routine of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557117">HBA_PORTSTAT_CALLBACK</a> that is called when an adapter is added to the system.


### -param pUserData

<p>Pointer to a buffer that is passed to the callback routine with each event. This data correlates the event with the source of the event registration. </p>


### -param Handle

<p>Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ff557097(v=VS.85).aspx"><b>HBA_OpenAdapter</b></a> that identifies the HBA for which the adapter events are generated. </p>


### -param PortWWN

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the HBA port from which port events are reported. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.


### -param stats

Pointer to a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557110">HBA_PortStatistics</a> that, on input, holds the statistical levels that determine when port statistics events are generated. On output, this member holds statistical data gathered for the port referenced by <i>PortWWN. </i>


### -param statType

Holds a value that indicates the mechanism used to trigger port statistics events. If the value is HBA_EVENT_PORT_STAT_THRESHOLD, then each non-NULL member of the HBA_PortStatistics structure pointed to by <i>stats </i>will indicate the threshold at which an event is generated for that particular statistical parameter. For example, if the <b>TxWords</b> member of the HBA_PortStatistics structure holds a value of 1,000,000, then an event will be generated once 1,000,000 words have been transmitted.

If the value of <i>statType </i>is HBA_EVENT_PORT_STAT_GROWTH, then the values in the HBA_PortStatistics structure will be interpreted as growth-rate numbers. The T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification recommends that port statistics be checked once a minute, and if the value or a given statistics parameter has grown by more than the number indicated for that parameter in HBA_PortStatistics, an event is generated, but the actual frequency with which growth is monitored is hardware-specific.


### -param pCallbackHandle

<p>Pointer to an opaque identifier that the user must pass to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ff557175(v=VS.85).aspx"><b>HBA_RemoveCallback</b></a> to de-register the callback routine.</p>




## -returns



The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortStatEvents</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, this member should have one of the following values.

<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>

<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not have a port with a name that matches the value in <i>PortWWN</i>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the hardware does not support statistic events. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the registration of the callback routine.
