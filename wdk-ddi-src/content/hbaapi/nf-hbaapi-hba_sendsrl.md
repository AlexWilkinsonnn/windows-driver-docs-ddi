# HBA_SendSRL function


## -description


The <b>HBA_SendSRL</b> routine issues a scan remote loop (SRL) request through the specified HBA to a specified domain controller. 


## -parameters




### -param Handle

<p>Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ff557097(v=VS.85).aspx"><b>HBA_OpenAdapter</b></a> that identifies the HBA through which the request is sent. </p>


### -param HbaPortWWN

<p>Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the port through which the SRL request is sent. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. </p>


### -param Wwn

<p>Contains a 64-bit WWN that uniquely identifies the FL_Port port that is associated with the loop that is scanned. The SRL request is sent to this port. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, it is ignored, and the SRL request is sent to the domain controller that is associated with the loop. The domain controller is identified by the value in <i>domain. </i></p>


### -param Domain

<p>Indicates the number of the domain controller associated with the loops to scan. If <i>wwn</i> is nonzero, this member is ignored.</p>


### -param pRspBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the output data of the SRL request. 


### -param pRspBufferSize [in, out]

On input, indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pRspBuffer</i>. On output, this member contains the number of bytes of data retrieved in <i>pRspBuffer</i>. If the buffer is not large enough to receive all of the response data, the data is truncated to the size of the buffer. Eight bytes is sufficient buffer space for any response. 


## -returns



The <b>HBA_SendSRL</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_SendSRL</b> returns one of the following values.

<table>

<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the complete payload of a reply to the SRL request was successfully retrieved.

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not contain a port with a name that matches <i>hbaPortWWN</i>. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ELS_REJECT</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the destination port referenced by <i>wwn, </i>or the domain controller referenced by <i>domain, </i>rejected the request node identification information data (RNID) that identifies the source HBA.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the execution of the SRL request. 

</td>
</tr>
