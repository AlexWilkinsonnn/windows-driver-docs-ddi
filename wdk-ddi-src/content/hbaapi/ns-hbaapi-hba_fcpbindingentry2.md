# HBA_FCPBindingEntry2 structure


## -description


The HBA_FCPBindingEntry2 structure defines a binding between the information that uniquely identifies a logical unit for the operating system and the fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifier for the logical unit.


## -struct-fields




### -field type

Contains a binding type that indicates how the target is specified in the binding. This member can have any of the following values: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Type Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_D_ID

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its fibre channel protocol (FCP) ID. The <b>Fcid</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556062">HBA_FcpId</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_WWPN

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its worldwide port name. The <b>PortWWN</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556062">HBA_FcpId</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_WWNN

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the fibre channel target device is identified by its worldwide node name. The <b>NodeWWN</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556062">HBA_FcpId</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_LUID

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its fibre channel logical unit ID. The <b>FcpLun</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556062">HBA_FcpId</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TARGETS

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the system should automatically generate target mappings from logical unit numbers to fibre channel protocol identifiers. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

For a comparable set of values that define how an HBA specifies targets and logical units in the persistent bindings that it maintains, see the WMI property qualifier <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556046">HBA_BIND_TYPE</a>. 

For a more detailed description of the values that this member can have, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. 


### -field ScsiId

Contains a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557191">HBA_ScsiId</a> that contains the information that uniquely identifies a logical unit for the operating system.


### -field FcpId

Contains a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556062">HBA_FcpId</a> that contains the FCP identifier for the logical unit and information about the port to be queried for information about the device.


### -field LUID

Contains a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557091">HBA_LUID</a> that holds a logical unit descriptor for the device that the operating system derives from SCSI inquiry data. 


### -field Status

Contains, on return, a status value that indicates the condition of the HBA. The status values that can be returned in this member correspond to the values associated with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> WMI property qualifier. 


## -remarks



This structure is very similar to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556035">HBAFCPBindingEntry2</a> structure. The only difference is that HBA_FCPBindingEntry2 returns HBA status.
