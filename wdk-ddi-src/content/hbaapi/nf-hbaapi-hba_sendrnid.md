# HBA_SendRNID function


## -description


The <b>HBA_SendRNID</b> routine sends a request for node identification data (RNID) to the indicated HBA, which in turn routes the request through the indicated port or node to the appropriate fabric configuration server. 


## -parameters




### -param Handle

<p>Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ff557097(v=VS.85).aspx"><b>HBA_OpenAdapter</b></a> that identifies the HBA that will route the command. The HBA routes this command to the appropriate fabric configuration server. </p>


### -param Wwn [in]

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies a port or a node from which the RNID command is issued. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. 


### -param WnnType

<p>Contains an enumerator value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ff557245(v=VS.85).aspx"><b>HBA_wwntype</b></a> that indicates whether the WWN specified by <i>Wwn </i>is a port or a node:</p>


### -param pRspBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that contains, in big-endian (wire) format, the payload data from the reply to the node identification request. 


### -param RspBufferSize [in, out]

On input, indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pRspBuffer</i>. On return, this member indicates the size, in bytes, of the response data. 


## -returns



The <b>HBA_SendRNID</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA.




## -remarks



The node identification data request is a common transport (CT) command that queries a fabric configuration server for node identification data. For a complete description of this command, see the sections dealing with node identification requests in the <i>Fibre Channel Generic Services - 4 (FC-GS-4)</i> specification published by the ANSI committee.

The <b>HBA_SendRNID</b> library routine serves a purpose very similar to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565459">SendRNID</a> WMI method.
