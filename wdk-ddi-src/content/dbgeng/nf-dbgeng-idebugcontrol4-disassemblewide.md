# IDebugControl4::DisassembleWide


## -description


The <b>DisassembleWide</b>  method disassembles a processor instruction in the target's memory.


## -parameters




### -param Offset [in]

Specifies the location in the target's memory of the instruction to disassemble.


### -param Flags [in]

Specifies the bit-flags that affect the behavior of this method.  Currently the only flag that can be set is DEBUG_DISASM_EFFECTIVE_ADDRESS; when set, the engine will compute the effective address from the current register information and display it.


### -param Buffer [out, optional]

Receives the disassembled instruction.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param BufferSize [in]

Specifies the size, in characters, of the <i>Buffer</i> buffer.


### -param DisassemblySize [out, optional]

Receives the size, in characters, of the disassembled instruction.  If <i>DisassemblySize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param EndOffset [out]

Receives the location in the target's memory of the instruction following the disassembled instruction.


## -returns



This method can also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.

## -remarks



The assembly language depends on the effective processor type of the target system.  For information about the assembly language, see the processor documentation.

The disassembly options--returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545605">GetAssemblyOptions</a>--affect the operation of this method.
