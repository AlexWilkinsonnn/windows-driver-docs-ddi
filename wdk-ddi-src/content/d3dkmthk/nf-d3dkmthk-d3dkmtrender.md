<div> </div>
For example, the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem puts a device into an error state if the display miniport driver indicated that a DMA buffer that was submitted from this device caused a fault or if the video memory manager could not page-in all of the allocations that are required for a DMA buffer even after splitting the DMA buffer. After a device is in an error state, it cannot perform any more operations and must be destroyed and recreated. The ICD can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546959">D3DKMTGetDeviceState</a> function to determine a more precise reason for the error.

This function might also return other <b>NTSTATUS</b> values.




## -remarks



A command buffer typically contains many graphics commands.  

If <b>D3DKMTRender</b> returns <b>STATUS_GRAPHICS_ALLOCATION_INVALID</b>, the OpenGL ICD should re-open or re-create the primary handle, replace all references in the command buffer to the previous handle with the new handle, and then call <b>D3DKMTRender</b> again to resubmit the buffer.

After a call to <b>D3DKMTRender</b>, the OpenGL ICD should determine the base address and size of the command buffer that it should use for its next submission from the values that are returned in the <b>pCommandBuffer</b> and <b>CommandBufferSize</b> members of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548238">D3DKMT_RENDER</a> structure that is pointed to by the <i>pData</i> parameter.

For a device that uses guaranteed DMA buffer contract mode (for more information about this mode, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fee6f7eb-157b-466d-b482-110a48045283">Using the Guaranteed Contract DMA Buffer Model</a>), the size of the DMA buffer that is available to the display miniport driver to translate the command buffer at the next submission is the same as the size of the command buffer itself. For such a device, the OpenGL ICD should also determine the size of the allocation list that will be available to the display miniport driver during the translation of the command buffer at the next submission from the value that is returned in the <b>AllocationListSize</b> member of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548238">D3DKMT_RENDER</a>. 

For devices that do not use guaranteed DMA buffer contract, the OpenGL ICD can use the information that is returned in the <b>CommandBufferSize</b> and <b>AllocationListSize</b> members to determine the size of the next DMA buffer and allocation list that will be available for translation. However, under low-memory conditions, the actual DMA buffer and allocation list that is provided to the display miniport driver might be smaller than required.

If the OpenGL ICD detects that most of the command buffer flushes are because the driver runs out of space in the command buffer or allocation list, the driver can request for them to be resized. To resize the command buffer, the driver sets the <b>ResizeCommandBuffer</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of D3DKMT_RENDER and puts the requested size in the <b>CommandBufferSize</b> member of D3DKMT_RENDER. Similarly, to resize the allocation list, the driver sets the <b>ResizeAllocationList</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of D3DKMT_RENDER and puts the requested number of elements in the <b>AllocationListSize</b> member of D3DKMT_RENDER.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Even though the driver can request for resizing of both the command buffer and the allocation list, the video memory manager might not be able to comply. Therefore, if the call to <b>D3DKMTRender</b> is successful, the driver should verify the values that are returned in the <b>pCommandBuffer</b>, <b>CommandBufferSize</b>, and <b>AllocationListSize</b> members.<p class="note">However, if the call to <b>D3DKMTRender</b> fails, the driver determines that the command buffer, the allocation list, or both were not resized. Therefore, the driver should not process the values that are returned in the <b>pCommandBuffer</b>, <b>CommandBufferSize</b>, and <b>AllocationListSize</b> members because they are invalid.

#### Examples

The following code example demonstrates how an OpenGL ICD can use <b>D3DKMTRender</b> to render 3-D primitives.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>HRESULT Render(D3DKMT_HANDLE hDevice, UINT CommandOffset, UINT CommandLength)
{
    D3DKMT_RENDER RenderData;

    memset(&amp;RenderData, 0, sizeof(RenderData));
    RenderData.hDevice = hDevice;
    RenderData.CommandOffset = CommandOffset;
    RenderData.CommandLength = CommandLength;

    if (NT_SUCCESS((*pfnKTRender)(&amp;RenderData))) {
        return S_OK;
    }
    return E_FAIL;
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
