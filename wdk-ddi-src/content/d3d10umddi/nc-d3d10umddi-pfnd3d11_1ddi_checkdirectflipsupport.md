# PFND3D11_1DDI_CHECKDIRECTFLIPSUPPORT callback function


## -description


Called by the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) to verify that the user-mode driver supports Direct Flip operations, in which video memory is seamlessly flipped between an application's managed primary allocations and the DWM's managed primary allocations.


## -parameters




### -param Arg1

*hDevice* [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param Arg2

*hResource1*

A resource in the application's swapchain.

### -param Arg3

*hResource2*

A resource in the DWM's swapchain.

### -param CheckDirectFlipFlags

If this parameter has a value of <b>D3D11_1DDI_CHECK_DIRECT_FLIP_IMMEDIATE</b>, seamless flipping should occur immediately and does not have to be synchronized with a VSync interrupt.


### -param *pSupported [out]

Set to <b>TRUE</b> if the driver can seamlessly flip video memory between  an application's managed primary allocations and the DWM's managed primary allocations. Otherwise, set to <b>FALSE</b>.


## -returns



This callback function does not return a value.




## -remarks



This function is called at least once before the DWM attempts to present to a Direct Flip swapchain. It is also called after each mode change occurs, or after the DWM re-creates its own swapchain for any reason.

The user-mode driver should ensure that the managed primary allocations of the application and the DWM have the following compatible resources:

<ul>
<li>Stereo resources.</li>
<li>Multiple Sample Anti Aliasing (MSAA) formats.</li>
<li>Swizzle formats. If the swizzle can only be changed at every VSync interval, ensure that the <i>CheckDirectFlipFlags</i> parameter does not have a value of <b>D3D11_1DDI_CHECK_DIRECT_FLIP_IMMEDIATE</b>.</li>
<li>Both managed primary allocations should be created using the same <b>VidPnSourceId</b> value in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544364">D3DDDI_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure.</li>
<li>Display adapter configurations are linked.</li>
</ul>
The user-mode driver might need to call the kernel-mode driver to perform these validations. To do this, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/66c0347f-2cf3-42fc-8641-47c731e958c9">pfnEscapeCb</a> callback function and then call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/144429e5-34e6-4416-980e-2838e8f9e415">DxgkCbGetHandleData</a> function to access the kernel-mode driver's resource allocation data.
