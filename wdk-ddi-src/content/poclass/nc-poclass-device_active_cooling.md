# DEVICE_ACTIVE_COOLING callback function


## -description


The <i>ActiveCooling</i> callback routine engages or disengages a device's active-cooling function.


## -parameters




### -param Context [in, out, optional]

A pointer to interface-specific context information. The caller sets this parameter to the value of the <b>Context</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh698275">THERMAL_COOLING_INTERFACE</a> structure that the driver previously supplied to the caller.


### -param Engaged [in]

Indicates whether to engage or disengage active cooling. If <b>TRUE</b>, the driver must engage active cooling (for example, by turning the fan on). If <b>FALSE</b>, the driver must disengage active cooling (for example, by turning the fan off).


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



The driver for a device that has active-cooling capabilities can implement this routine to enable the operating system to engage or disengage the active-cooling function in the device.

For example, if the active-cooling function is a fan that can be turned on and off, the caller sets <i>Engaged</i> = <b>TRUE</b> to turn the fan on, and sets <i>Engaged</i> = <b>FALSE</b> to turn the fan off.

Initially, before the first call to the <i>ActiveCooling</i> routine, the active-cooling function in the device must be disengaged (for example, the fan must be turned off).

The driver for a device that does not have active-cooling capabilities should set the <b>ActiveCooling</b> member of the <b>THERMAL_COOLING_INTERFACE</b> structure to <b>NULL</b>.

For more information about active cooling, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh698271">Passive and Active Cooling Modes</a>.
