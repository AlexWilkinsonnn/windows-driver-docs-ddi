#### - MultiSampleCaps

<b>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</b> Structure that contains the following two members. It specifies 16-bitmasks for the number of samples per pixel for both flip (fullscreen) and blt (windowed) multisampling. It is used when specifying surfaces that can be used when performing multisample rendering (see the Remarks section). Each bit in these 16-bitmasks indicates support of multisampling with a specific number of samples. For example, bit 0 indicates the support of multisampling with only a single sample, bit 1 indicates the support of multisampling with two samples, bit 2 indicates the support of multisampling with three samples, and so on. The driver can indicate more than one supported level by combining the bits using a bitwise OR (see Remarks).



#### wFlipMSTypes

<b>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</b> Specifies a 16-bitmask for fullscreen multisampling.



#### wBltMSTypes

<b>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</b> Specifies a 16-bitmask for windowed multisampling.


#### - dwBumpBitCount

Specifies the total number of bits per "bumpel" (bump-map texel).


#### - dwBumpDuBitMask

Specifies the mask for bump map U delta bits.


#### - dwBumpDvBitMask

Specifies the mask for bump map V delta bits.


#### - dwBumpLuminanceBitMask

Specifies the mask for luminance in a bump map.


#### - dwLuminanceAlphaBitMask

Specifies the mask for luminance in the alpha channel.


#### - dwLuminanceBitCount

Specifies the number of bits per pixel.


#### - dwLuminanceBitMask

Specifies the mask for luminance bits.


#### - dwOperations

<b>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</b> Specifies the intended operations that can be performed on surfaces with this pixel format, for example, whether such surfaces can be used as textures, bump environment maps, cube maps, volume textures, or render targets. The operations that can be reported are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Operation</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_TEXTURE

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as MIP mapped textures.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_VOLUMETEXTURE

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as volume textures. Please note, that this flag is independent of D3DFORMAT_OP_TEXTURE. Thus, it is possible to specify a pixel format that can only be used for volume textures and not for conventional, MIP mapped textures.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_CUBETEXTURE

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as cubic environment map textures. Please note, that this flag is independent of D3DFORMAT_OP_TEXTURE. Thus, it is possible to specify a pixel format that can only be used for cubic environment map textures and not for conventional, MIP mapped textures.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_OFFSCREEN_RENDERTARGET

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as an offscreen render target regardless of the pixel format of the display mode (providing the pixel format of the current display mode was reported with the D3DFORMAT_OP_DISPLAYMODE and D3DFORMAT_OP_3DACCELERATION). If the pixel format of the current display mode did not have these flags set it indicates no 3D acceleration is available in this mode even if the render target is offscreen. This flag can be combined with D3DFORMAT_OP_TEXTURE to indicate that the device can render to textures of the specified pixel format.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_SAME_FORMAT_RENDERTARGET

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as render targets but only when the pixel format of the surface matches the pixel format of the current display mode. This flag does not only apply to offscreen render target but can be specified on the pixel formats of display modes to indicate rendering target capability. This flag can be combined with D3DFORMAT_OP_TEXTURE to indicate that the device can render to textures of the specified pixel format.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_ZSTENCIL

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as Z/Stencil buffers but only if the depth of the Z/Stencil surface matches the color depth of the rendering target to which the depth buffer is attached. When deciding on a match between Z/Stencil and color buffer depth, the pixel stride is used.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_ZSTENCIL_WITH_ARBITRARY_COLOR_DEPTH

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as Z/Stencil buffers regardless of the color depth of the render target to which the surface is attached. When specifying this flag you also should specify D3DFORMAT_OP_ZSTENCIL.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_SAME_FORMAT_UP_TO_ALPHA_RENDERTARGET

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified in a pixel format, it indicates that surfaces of this format can be used as a render target if the current display mode is the same depth, if the alpha channel is ignored. For example, if the device can render to A8R8G8B8 when the display mode is X8R8G8B8, then the format operation list entry for A8R8G8B8 should have this flag set.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_DISPLAYMODE

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified, it indicates that there is a display mode with this pixel format that has DirectDraw support (including Flip). This flag should not be set on alpha formats.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DFORMAT_OP_3DACCELERATION

</td>
<td>
When this flag is specified, the graphics accelerator can support some level of Direct3D acceleration when in a display mode with this pixel format and also implies that the driver can create a context in this mode (for some render target format). This flag can only be used when reporting display mode formats (by specifying the D3DFORMAT_OP_DISPLAYMODE). It is not required and indeed should not be set when reporting offscreen render targets formats.

Specify the masks for alpha channel. 


#### - dwRGBZBitMask, dwYUVZBitMask

Specifies the masks for the z channel. 


#### - dwStencilBitDepth

Specifies the bit depth of the stencil buffer. This member specifies how many bits are reserved within each pixel of the z-buffer for stencil information.

Specifies the mask for stencil bits within each z-buffer pixel.


#### - dwZBitMask

Specifies the mask for Z bits.


## -remarks



The DirectX 8.0 and later runtime imposes the following rules on the operation (op) list:

<ul>
<li>
Only one Endian-ness (big or little) for any DS format is allowed, for example D15S1 or S1D15, not both independent of other bits.

</li>
<li>
A list should only include D3DFORMAT_OP_DISPLAYMODE for exactly one 16bpp format (for example it should not enumerate 5:5:5 and 5:6:5).

</li>
<li>
A list should not contain any alpha formats with D3DFORMAT_OP_DISPLAYMODE or D3DFORMAT_OP_3DACCELLERATION set.

</li>
<li>
The D3DFORMAT_OP_3DACCELLERATION flag can only be set when the D3DFORMAT_OP_DISPLAYMODE flag is also set.

</li>
</ul>
If the driver supports a lockable D16, it should report D3DFMT_D16_LOCKABLE in the op list; otherwise, it should report D3DFMT_D16.

Drivers supporting multisampling must fill in the <b>MultiSampleCaps</b> in the Depth/Stencil formats for which multisampling can be supported. This allows the runtime to detect if a driver supports multisampling for combinations of render target and Z buffer formats. For additional information about the restrictions related to stretch blt multisampling, see the description of D3DPRASTERCAPS_STRETCHBLTMULTISAMPLE cap in the rastercaps contained in the D3DCAPS8 structure in the SDK documentation.

The enumerated type D3DMULTISAMPLE_TYPE defined in <i>d3d8types.h</i> is used when setting the bits in <b>wFlipMSTypes</b> and <b>wBltMSTypes</b>. To specify support for a specific number of samples per pixel, simply logically shift 1 by the appropriate value from the D3DMULTISAMPLE_TYPE enumerated type less 1 and OR this into the appropriate field (<b>wFlipMSTypes</b> and <b>wBltMSTypes</b>).

For example, if the driver supports both two and four samples per pixel when flipping (fullscreen mode) and four samples per pixel when blitting (windowed mode) on X8R8G8B8 surface the following entry would be reported in the surface format list.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>

ddpf.dwSize       = sizeof(DDPIXELFORMAT);
ddpf.dwFlags      = DDPF_D3DFORMAT;
ddpf.dwFourCC     = D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8;
ddpf.dwOperations = D3DFORMAT_OP_DISPLAYMODE |
                    D3DFORMAT_OP_3DACCELERATION;

ddpf.MultiSampleCaps.wBltMSTypes = (1 &lt;&lt; (D3DMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES Ã¢Ëâ 1));</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
It is not necessary to specify 1 &lt;&lt; (D3DMULTISAMPLE_NONE - 1) when reporting formats. It is assumed that any format reported can also be used without multisampling. If the hardware supports multisample rendering with a z-buffer the z-buffer formats reported should also include the supported samples-per-pixels.
