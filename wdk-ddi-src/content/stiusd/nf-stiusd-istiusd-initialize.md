# IStiUSD::Initialize


## -description


A still image minidriver's <b>IStiUSD::Initialize</b> method initializes an instance of the COM object that defines the <b>IStiUSD</b> interface.


## -parameters




### -param pHelDcb




### -param dwStiVersion

Caller-supplied STI version number. This value is defined by STI_VERSION in <i>Sti.h</i>.


### -param hParametersKey

Caller-supplied handle to the registry key under which device-specific information is to be stored.


#### - pDcb

Caller-supplied pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6d98f5d7-c471-4abb-8e69-dbac3d336c2f">IStiDeviceControl COM Interface</a>.


## -returns



If the operation succeeds, the method should return S_OK. Otherwise, it should return one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.




## -remarks



The <b>IStiUSD::Initialize</b> method, which is exported by still image minidrivers, is the first <b>IStiUSD</b> method called after a minidriver has been loaded. The method must initialize the driver and device.

The method should store the received <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6d98f5d7-c471-4abb-8e69-dbac3d336c2f">IStiDeviceControl COM Interface</a> pointer, and it should call that interface's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542933">IStiDeviceControl::AddRef</a> method.

For devices connected to dedicated ports (such as SCSI devices), the method typically creates a read/write path to the device by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80a96083-4de9-4422-9705-b8ad2b6cbd1b">CreateFile</a> (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation), using a device port name obtained by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542944">IStiDeviceControl::GetMyDevicePortName</a>.

For devices on shared ports (such as serial port devices), opening the port in the <b>IStiUSD::Initialize</b> method is not recommended, because access to other devices on the port will be locked out. For such devices, it is better to call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80a96083-4de9-4422-9705-b8ad2b6cbd1b">CreateFile</a> from within the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543829">IStiUSD::LockDevice</a> method.

 If the device being opened is one for which multiple calls to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80a96083-4de9-4422-9705-b8ad2b6cbd1b">CreateFile</a> are not allowed (such as devices connected to a serial port), the driver typically does not call <b>CreateFile</b> unless the caller has opened the device for data transfers, as illustrated in the following <b>CodeExample</b>.

The <b>IStiUSD::Initialize</b> method should validate the received STI version number and return an error if the received version does not match the driver's version.

The following example opens a device port only if a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542942">IStiDeviceControl::GetMyDeviceOpenMode</a> indicates an application has opened the device for data transfers. Such code might be used for a device that cannot support multiple <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80a96083-4de9-4422-9705-b8ad2b6cbd1b">CreateFile</a> calls, such as a serial port device.
