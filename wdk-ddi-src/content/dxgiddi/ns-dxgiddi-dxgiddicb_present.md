# DXGIDDICB_PRESENT structure


## -description


The DXGIDDICB_PRESENT structure describes allocations that content is copied to and from. 


## -struct-fields




### -field hSrcAllocation

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the source allocation. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a61e6c6a-3992-429c-ad8c-5f1a61dc7b8b">pfnAllocateCb</a> function returns this handle. Therefore, the user-mode display driver should use this handle to copy content from.


### -field hDstAllocation

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the destination allocation. <b>hDstAllocation</b> can be zero if the destination is unknown; kernel mode will determine the destination just before sending the hardware command stream through DMA to the graphics processor.


### -field pDXGIContext

[in] A handle to the Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) context. This handle is opaque to the driver. The driver should assign the handle from the <b>pDXGIContext</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557464">DXGI_DDI_ARG_PRESENT</a> structure that the driver received in a call to its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569179">PresentDXGI</a> function to this member. 


### -field hContext

[in] A handle to the context that the driver submits the copy operation to. The user-mode display driver previously created this context by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function. 


### -field BroadcastContextCount

[in] The number of additional contexts in the array that the <b>BroadcastContext</b> member specifies.


### -field BroadcastContext

[in] An array of handles to the additional contexts to broadcast the current present operation to. The <b>D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT</b> constant, which is defined as 64, defines the maximum number of additional contexts that the user-mode display driver can broadcast the current present operation to. 

Broadcasting is supported only for flip operations. To broadcast a flip operation, the display miniport driver must support memory mapped I/O (MMIO)-based flips. To indicate support of MMIO flips, the display miniport driver sets the <b>FlipOnVSyncMmIo</b> bit-field flag in the <b>FlipCaps</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561062">DXGK_DRIVERCAPS</a> structure when its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f2f4c54c-7413-48e5-a165-d71f35642b6c">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function is called.

The original context that the <b>hContext</b> member specifies and that the user-mode display driver presents to is not an element in the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array. For example, if the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array contains one element, the user-mode display driver sends the present operation to the owning context (<b>hContext</b>) and broadcasts to that one additional context. 


### -field BroadcastSrcAllocation

 
Allocations which content will be presented.

### -field BroadcastDstAllocation

If non-zero, represents the destination allocations of the present.


### -field PrivateDriverDataSize

 
Private driver data size in bytes.

### -field pPrivateDriverData

 
Private driver data to pass to DxgiPresent.

### -field bOptimizeForComposition

 
DWM is involved in composition.

### -field SyncIntervalOverrideValid

Override app sync interval is valid. 


### -field SyncIntervalOverride

 
Override app sync interval.
