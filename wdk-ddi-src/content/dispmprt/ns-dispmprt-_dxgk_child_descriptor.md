# _DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR structure holds identification and capability information for an individual child device of the display adapter.


## -struct-fields




### -field ChildDeviceType

A member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561008">DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE</a> enumeration that indicates the type of the child device.


### -field ChildCapabilities

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560995">DXGK_CHILD_CAPABILITIES</a> structure that describes the capabilities of the child device.


### -field AcpiUid

If the child device is an ACPI device, this member contains the unique ACPI identifier of the child device.


### -field ChildUid

A unique identifier, created by the display miniport driver, that identifies the child device.


## -remarks



The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/eb1a0df0-6239-4d82-8477-7dd015f80b6e">DxgkDdiQueryChildRelations</a> function, implemented by the display miniport driver, fills in an array of DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR structures, one for each child device of the display adapter.

Each child device of type <b>TypeVideoOutput</b> is associated with a video present target, and the <b>ChildUid</b> member of this structure is used as the identifier for that video present target. Several functions implemented by the video present network (VidPN) manager receive a video present target identifier. For an example, see the <i>VidPnTargetId</i> parameter of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1b91c472-21eb-4aa8-91e3-c9eb70556d9f">pfnAcquireTargetModeSet</a> function.
