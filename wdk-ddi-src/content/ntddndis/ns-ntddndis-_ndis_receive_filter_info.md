# _NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO structure


## -description



The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure contains information about a receive filter that is currently configured on a miniport driver.



NDIS receive filters are used in the following NDIS interfaces:
<ul>
<li>

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/500FBF0F-54D9-4675-8E2D-447387DA8798">NDIS Packet Coalescing</a>.

## -struct-fields




### -field Header

The 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the
     <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure. The driver sets the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the structure that 
     <b>Header</b> specifies to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.

To indicate the version of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure, the driver sets the 
     <b>Revision</b> member to one of the following values:





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_REVISION_1

Original version for NDIS 6.20.

The driver sets the 
        <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_REVISION_1.


### -field Flags

A bitwise OR of flags. This member is reserved for NDIS.


### -field FilterType

The type of the receive filter.


### -field FilterId

A receive filter identifier. The filter identifier
     is an integer from one up to and including the number of receive filters that the network adapter
     supports. A value of zero is not valid.


## -remarks



The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure is used with the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/32896b46-1143-4598-ad15-2eb4dbdea6e8">
    NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</a> structure for the 
    OID request of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-receive-filter-enum-filters">OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_ENUM_FILTERS</a>. This OID request enumerates receive filters that have been configured on the miniport driver. This includes packet coalescing receive filters or the receive filters configured on a  receive queue that is used in the VMQ or SR-IOV interface.
