# _NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS structure


## -description


The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS</b> structure specifies the receive filtering features that are
  enabled or disabled on a network adapter.

NDIS receive filters are used in the following NDIS interfaces:
<ul>
<li>

## -struct-fields




### -field Header

The 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the
     <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS</b> structure. The driver sets the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the structure that 
     <b>Header</b> specifies to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.

To indicate the version of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS</b> structure, the driver sets the 
     <b>Revision</b> member to one of the following values:





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1

Original version for NDIS 6.20.

The driver sets the 
        <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1.


### -field Flags

A bitwise OR of flags. This member is reserved for NDIS.


### -field EnabledFilterTypes

A  bitwise OR of flags for types of enabled receive filters. The
     following filter type flag is valid.
     





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_VMQ_FILTERS_ENABLED

Specifies that VMQ filters are enabled.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The miniport driver should set this flag if the miniport driver is enabled to use the SR-IOV interface. For more information on how these interfaces are enabled, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/EF556563-4097-4388-A563-29FC891AC626">Handling SR-IOV, VMQ, and RSS Standardized INF Keywords</a>.</div>
<div> </div>


#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_PACKET_COALESCING_FILTERS_ENABLED

Specifies that NDIS packet coalescing receive filters are enabled.


### -field EnabledQueueTypes

A  bitwise OR of flags for types of enabled receive queues. The
     following queue type flag is valid.
     





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_VM_QUEUES_ENABLED

Specifies that virtual machine (VM) queues are enabled.  VM queues are used in the VMQ and SR-IOV interface.


## -remarks



The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS</b> structure is used in the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-receive-filter-global-parameters">
    OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS</a> query OID to obtain the current global receive filter
    settings.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Many of the members and flag settings of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_GLOBAL_PARAMETERS</b> structure are valid if the miniport driver is enabled to use the VMQ or SR-IOV interface. The miniport driver is enabled to use these interfaces through standardized INF keywords. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/EF556563-4097-4388-A563-29FC891AC626">Handling SR-IOV, VMQ, and RSS Standardized INF Keywords</a>.</div>
