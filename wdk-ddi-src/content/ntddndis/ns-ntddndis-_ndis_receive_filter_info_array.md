# _NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY structure


## -description



The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</b> structure specifies a list of receive filters that are currently configured on a miniport driver.



NDIS receive filters are used in the following NDIS interfaces:
<ul>
<li>

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/500FBF0F-54D9-4675-8E2D-447387DA8798">NDIS Packet Coalescing</a>. For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/20EA71E0-B880-4891-A12E-76F4C9AB16E6">Managing Packet Coalescing Receive Filters</a>.

</li>
<li>

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E64DD4F0-D5F8-4FFF-931B-C04C5C42D000">Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)</a>.

</li>
</ul>

## -struct-fields




### -field Header

The type, revision, and size of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</b> structure. This member is formatted as an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.

The miniport driver must set the <b>Type</b> member of <b>Header</b> to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT. To specify the version of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</b> structure, the driver must set the <b>Revision</b> member of <b>Header</b> to the following value: 





#### NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY_REVISION_2

Added members for NDIS 6.30.

Set the <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY_REVISION_2.



#### NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY_REVISION_1

Original version for NDIS 6.20.

Set the <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY_REVISION_1.


### -field QueueId

A receive queue identifier. This identifier is an
     integer between zero and the number of queues that the network adapter supports. A value of NDIS_DEFAULT_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID specifies
     the default receive queue.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Miniport drivers that support <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/500FBF0F-54D9-4675-8E2D-447387DA8798">NDIS packet coalescing</a> or SR-IOV interface must set the <b>QueueId</b> member to NDIS_DEFAULT_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field FirstElementOffset

The offset, in bytes, to the first element in an array of elements that follow this structure. The offset is measured from the start of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</b> structure up to the beginning of the first element. Each element in the array is an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567176">NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</a> structure.



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If <b>NumElements</b> is set to zero, this member is ignored.  </div>
<div> </div>

### -field NumElements

The number of elements in the array.


### -field ElementSize

The size, in bytes, of each element in the array.


### -field Flags

A  bitwise OR of the following flags: 





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY_VPORT_ID_SPECIFIED

If this flag is set, information is requested about receive filters that are configured on the virtual port (VPort) specified by the <b>VPortId</b> member.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This flag is only valid for the SR-IOV interface.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field VPortId

The virtual port (VPort) identifier on which receive filters are being queried. The VPort identifier must be one of the following values:

<ul>
<li>


The identifier of a VPort that was previously allocated through an OID method request of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451816">OID_NIC_SWITCH_CREATE_VPORT</a>.



</li>
<li>
A value of NDIS_DEFAULT_VPORT_ID that specifies the default VPort on the NIC switch.



</li>
</ul>
A NIC switch is supported by network adapters for the SR-IOV interface. The NIC switch can be configured to have one or more VPorts.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <b>VPortId</b> member is only valid if the NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY_VPORT_ID_SPECIFIED flag is set in <b>Flags</b>. 
</div>
<div> </div>

## -remarks



The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</b> structure is used in the 
    OID request of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-receive-filter-enum-filters">
    OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_ENUM_FILTERS</a>. This OID request enumerates the receive filters on a VMQ  or SR-IOV receive queue. Each
    element in the array that follows the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</b> structure is an 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/12029cfd-58d0-4621-8cbc-c07e68db61b8">
    NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</a> structure.
