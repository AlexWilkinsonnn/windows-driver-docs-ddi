# IOCTL_WAIT_ON_DEVICE_EVENT IOCTL


## -description


Returns information about an event occurring on a USB interrupt pipe.


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

<b>NULL</b>


### -input-buffer-length

Zero.


### -output-buffer

Pointer to a buffer that is large enough to receive the largest packet the device is capable of sending on the interrupt pipe.


### -output-buffer-length

Size of the output buffer.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise, <b>Status</b> to the appropriate error condition as a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> code. 


## -remarks



<h3><a id="ddk_ioctl_wait_on_device_event_si"></a><a id="DDK_IOCTL_WAIT_ON_DEVICE_EVENT_SI"></a>DeviceIoControl Parameters</h3>


When the <b>DeviceloControl</b> function is called with the IOCTL_WAIT_ON_DEVICE_EVENT control code, the caller must specify a buffer pointer as the function's <i>lpOutBuffer</i> parameter. The buffer must be large enough to hold the largest packet the device can send on its interrupt pipe.

The type and size of information returned are device-specific. For example, a still image device might issue an interrupt when a user presses one of its buttons, and the return packet might indicate which button was pressed.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f9216d3c-4930-4c26-8eac-6ee500b038e0">Accessing Kernel-Mode Drivers for Still Image Devices</a>.
