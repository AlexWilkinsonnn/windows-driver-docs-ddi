# _PO_FX_PERF_STATE structure


## -description


The <b>PO_FX_PERF_STATE</b> structure represents a performance state for a single component within a device.


## -struct-fields




### -field Value

The value of this performance state. The units are specified by the <b>Unit</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn939833">PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</a> that contains this performance state. For example, if <b>Value</b> is 100000000 and the <b>Unit</b> member of the  <b>PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</b> is <b>PoFxPerfStateUnitFrequency</b>, this performance state represents 100 MHz.


### -field Context

A pointer to additional context for the performance state that cannot be presented by the <b>Value</b> member. This data can be shared between the driver and the platform extension plug-in (PEP).

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Using the <b>Context</b> member can hinder the visualization of performance states in Windows Performance Analyzer.</div>
<div> </div>

## -remarks



The <b>States</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn939833">PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</a> structure contains an array of <b>PO_FX_PERF_STATE</b> elements.
