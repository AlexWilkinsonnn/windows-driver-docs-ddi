Returns all packets in a datapath queue's packet ring buffer that have the **Completed** flag set.

## -parameters

### -param Descriptor

A pointer to the datapath queue's [NET_DATAPATH_DESCRIPTOR](../netdatapathdescriptor/ns-netdatapathdescriptor-_net_datapath_descriptor.md) structure.

### -param BatchSize

The number of packets to return in this batch.

## -returns

This method does not return a value.

## -remarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This method must only be called within the context of *EvtPacketQueueAdvance* or *EvtPacketQueueCancel*. At no other time should the client driver call this helper method, or any other helper method, that modifies the **BeginIndex** of either the fragment or packet ring buffers.

Call **NetTx(Rx)QueueGetDatapathDescriptor** to obtain the datapath descriptor structure for the queue with which you're working.

The NetAdapter data path requires packets to be completed in the order that they are given to your driver. If your driver can complete some packets out of order, you can use **NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets** to simplify your completion path.

To use this convenience method, first set the **Completed** flag on the first fragment of all packets with which your driver is finished, whether the packets were processed successfully or not. Then, call **NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets** to batch the completion of all consecutive packets for which the first fragment has the **Completed** flag set.

**NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets** completes packets by writing a new value to the **BeginIndex** of the ring buffer.

If you always complete packets in order, it is more efficient to write to **BeginIndex** directly, rather than using the **Completed** flag with **NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets**.

When you use **NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets**, it is most efficient to flag all finished packets and call the routine just once.



### Example
This example shows how a simple data path can complete packets if the hardware completes I/O requests in the order in which they were issued. Note that this data path just writes to **BeginIndex** directly.

```C++
for (UINT i = ringBuffer->BeginIndex; 
     i != ringBuffer->EndIndex; 
     i = NetRingBufferIncrementIndex(ringBuffer, i))
{
  NET_PACKET *packet = NetRingBufferGetPacketAtIndex(ringBuffer, i);
  if (!MyHardwareIsDoneWithPacket(packet))
    break;

  // Complete the packet to the OS, simply by updating BeginIndex
  ringBuffer->BeginIndex = i;
}
```

But suppose that your hardware or lower edge completes packets out of order. Now you cannot just assign the index of the most recently completed packet to **BeginIndex**. Instead, use the **Completed** flag on the first fragment in the packet, then call **NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets** to return packets safely.

In this example, the lower edge returns a linked list of I/O completion blocks, and the list is not sorted in the order in which the I/O requests were issued. This example works with a transmit (Tx) queue.

```c++
void MyPacketCompletionCallback(MY_IO_REQUEST *io, NETTXQUEUE txqueue)
{
  // Get the datapath descriptor for this queue
  PCNET_DATAPATH_DESCRIPTOR descriptor = NetTxQueueGetDatapathDescriptor(txqueue);

  // Start a counter for how many packets to return in this batch
  UINT32 batchSize = 0;

  while (io) {
    NET_PACKET* packet = io->Packet;
    packet->Completed = TRUE;
    batchSize++;

    // Walk the linked list
    io = io->Next;
  }

  // Complete any packets to the OS.  Updates BeginIndex for us.
  NetRingBufferReturnCompletedPackets(descriptor, batchSize);
}
```
