The NetRingBufferReturnAllPackets method returns all packets in a datapath queue's packet ring buffer.

## -parameters

### -param Descriptor
A pointer to the datapath queue's [NET_DATAPATH_DESCRIPTOR](../netdatapathdescriptor/ns-netdatapathdescriptor-_net_datapath_descriptor.md) structure.

## -returns
This method does not return a value.

## -remarks
Call **NetTx(Rx)QueueGetDatapathDescriptor** to obtain the datapath descriptor structure for the queue with which you're working.

This method is a convenience function to return all outstanding packets. Typically, you would call this method from your [*EvtPacketQueueCancel*](../netpacketqueue/nc-netpacketqueue-evt_packet_queue_cancel.md) callback function for a receive queue.
