Increments the **NextIndex** value of the packet ring buffer, then returns a pointer to the packet at the new **NextIndex** value.

## -parameters

### -param Descriptor
A pointer to the datapath queue's [NET_DATAPATH_DESCRIPTOR](../netdatapathdescriptor/ns-netdatapathdescriptor-_net_datapath_descriptor.md) structure.

## -returns
Returns **NULL** if the ring buffer's **NextIndex** equals its **EndIndex**, meaning there are no more unprocessed packets. Otherwise, this routine returns a pointer to the [NET_PACKET](../netpacket/ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md) at the new **NextIndex** value of the ring buffer.

## -remarks
Call **NetTx(Rx)QueueGetDatapathDescriptor** to obtain the datapath descriptor structure for the queue with which you're working.

Typically, your driver would use **NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket** in a loop to issue packets to hardware.

For example:

```c++
NET_PACKET *nextPacket;
while (NULL != (nextPacket = NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket(descriptor))) {
  ProgramPacketToMyHardware(nextPacket);
}
```
