# IMiniportPnpNotify interface


## -description


IMiniportPnpNotify is an optional interface to allow miniport objects (audio subdevices)  to receive PnP state change notifications.


IMiniportPnpNotify interface available is on both WaveRT and Topology.

Miniports have an opportunity to receive a PnP Stop notification for each audio subdevice they have registered. To receive this notification, the subdevice must support IMiniportPnpNotify.
 Only the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt604856">IMiniportPnpNotify::PnpStop</a> notification is defined on this interface.

IAdapterPnpManagement is available in WindowsÂ 10, version 1511 and later versions of Windows.
