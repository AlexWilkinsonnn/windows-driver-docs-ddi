### -field dtcTransformCaps

Specifies a D3DTRANSFORMCAPS structure that specifies the transformation capabilities of the device. The driver must set the <b>dwCaps</b> member of that structure to zero.


### -field bClipping

Set to <b>TRUE</b> by the driver if the device can perform 3D clipping. 


### -field dlcLightingCaps

Specifies the lighting capabilities of the device. This is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548471">D3DLIGHTINGCAPS</a> structure. The driver must set the <b>dwCaps</b>, <b>dwLightingModel</b>, and <b>dwNumLights</b> members of that structure to zero.


### -field dpcLineCaps

Specifies a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549034">D3DPRIMCAPS</a> structure that defines the drawing capabilities of the device for line primitives.


### -field dpcTriCaps

Specifies a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549034">D3DPRIMCAPS</a> structure that defines the drawing capabilities of the device for triangle primitives.


### -field dwDeviceRenderBitDepth

Specifies the device's rendering bit-depth. This member can be a bitwise OR of the following DirectDraw bit-depth constants: DDBD_8, DDBD_16, DDBD_24, or DDBD_32. 


### -field dwDeviceZBufferBitDepth

Specifies the device's z-buffer bit-depth. This member can be a bitwise OR of the following DirectDraw bit-depth constants: DDBD_8, DDBD_16, DDBD_24, or DDBD_32.


### -field dwMaxBufferSize

Must be set to zero.


### -field dwMaxVertexCount



DirectX 7 and later versions

DirectX 6

 


## -remarks



This structure has been replaced by D3DCAPS8 (see the DirectX 8.0 SDK documentation) for DirectX 8.0 and later runtimes, but is required for legacy runtime (DirectX 7.0 and earlier) compatibility. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a03a7cbc-95be-4251-8e3a-bef4a093f03d">Reporting DirectX 8.0 Style Direct3D Capabilities</a> for details.

The driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556229">DrvGetDirectDrawInfo</a> function returns this information in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545963">D3DHAL_GLOBALDRIVERDATA</a> structure that the <b>lpD3DGlobalDriverData</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551627">DD_HALINFO</a> structure points to.

The Direct3D runtime constructs the application-level D3DDEVICEDESC7 structure (documented in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation) from the information returned in the D3DDEVICEDESC_V1 structure and the extended capabilities queried through the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/89a22163-a678-4c72-932a-ae4d17922e0b">DdGetDriverInfo</a> function. While some of the <b>dwDevCaps</b> flags are obsolete at the driver level, the driver must set them appropriately in order for applications to work correctly.
